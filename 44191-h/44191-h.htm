<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The present work is the natural product of some
years devoted to a study of the speech and habits of
monkeys. It has led up to the special study of the
great apes. The matter contained herein is chiefly
a record of the facts tabulated during recent years
in that field of research.</p>

<p>The aim in view is to convey to the casual reader
a more correct idea than now prevails concerning
the physical, mental, and social habits of these
apes.</p>

<p>The favourable conditions under which the writer
has been placed, in the study of these animals in
the freedom of their native jungle, have not hitherto
been enjoyed by any other student of Nature.</p>

<p>A careful aim to avoid all technical terms and
scientific phraseology has been adhered to, and the
subject treated in a simple style. Tedious details
are relieved by an ample supply of anecdotes taken
from the writer's own observations, and most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
them are the acts of his own pets or of apes in a
wild state. The author has refrained from rash
deductions and abstruse theories, but has sought to
place the animals here treated in their true light,
believing that to dignify the apes is not to degrade
man, but to exalt him even more.</p>

<p>It is hoped that a more perfect knowledge of
these animals may bring man into closer fellowship
and deeper sympathy with Nature, and cause him
to realise that all creatures think and feel in some
degree, however small.</p>

<span class="subhead">MAN AND APE COMPARED</span></h2>

<p>Monkeys have always been a subject of idle interest
to old and young; but they have usually served to
amuse the masses more than to instruct them, until
within recent years.</p>

<p>Now that science has brought them within the
field of careful research, and made them an object
of serious study, it has invested them with a certain
dignity in the esteem of mankind, and imparted to
them a new aspect among animals.</p>

<p>There is no other creature that so charms and
fascinates the beholder as do these little effigies of
the human race. The simple and the wise are alike
impressed with their human look and manner;
children and patriarchs with equal delight watch
them with surprise; but now that the search-light
of science is being thrown into every nook and
crevice of nature, human interest in them is
multiplied many fold, while the savants of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
civilised lands are struggling with the problem of
their possible relationship to man.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the desire of learning as much as
possible about their natural habits, faculties, and
resources, they are being studied from every available
point of view, and every characteristic compared
in detail to the corresponding one in man. Hence,
in order to appreciate more fully the value of the
lessons to be drawn from the contents of this
volume, we must know the relative planes in the
scale of nature that man and monkeys occupy,
wherefore we shall begin our task by comparing
them in a general way; but as the scope of this
work is restricted mainly to the great apes, the comparison
will likewise be confined to that subject,
except in so far as to define the relations of man
and ape to monkeys.</p>

<p>Since monkeys differ among themselves so widely,
it is evident that all of them cannot in the same
degree resemble man. And as the degree of interest
in them as a subject of comparative study is approximately
measured by the degree of their
likeness to man, it is apparent that all cannot be
regarded as of equal interest. But since each forms
an integral part of the scale of nature, they are of
equal importance in tracing out the continuity of the
order to which they belong.</p>

<p>The vast family of simians has perhaps the widest
range of types of any single family of mammals.
Beginning with the great apes, which so closely
resemble man in size, form and structure, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
descend by degrees along the scale till they end in
the little marmosets, which are almost on the level
of rodents. But the descent is so gradual that it is
difficult to draw a sharp line of demarcation at any
point between the two extremes. There is, however,
now an effort being made to separate
this family into smaller groups, but the lines
between them must be dim and wavering, and the
literature of the past has a tendency to retard the
effort.</p>

<p>We shall not digress from the trend of our subject,
however, at this time, to discuss the problems
with which zoology may have to contend in the
future, but will accept the current system and
proceed.</p>

<p>All the varied types that belong to the simian
family are, in the common order of speech, known
as <i class="classification">monkeys</i>, but the term thus used is so broad in its
meaning as to include all the forms of that vast
group, wherefore it is vague and obscure, for some
of these resemble man more than they resemble
each other. The name should only be applied to
those having tails and short faces, but there is a
small group, which have no tails at all, that are
properly known as <i class="classification">apes</i>. While they are all simians,
they are not all monkeys. It is with this small
group, without tails, that we propose chiefly to deal.
We select them because of their likeness to man,
and having noted the similitude, the result may be
compared with other types of the same order. There
are only four of these apes, but as a whole they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
resemble man in so many essential details that they
are called "anthropoid," or "man-like apes." They
differ from each other in certain respects, almost as
much as any one of them differs from man. The
four apes alluded to, are the chimpanzee, the gorilla,
the orang and the gibbon.</p>

<p>As the skeleton is the framework of the physical
structure, it will serve as the basis upon which to
build up the comparison, and as the chimpanzee is
the nearest approach to man, we select him as the
highest type of the simian, and use him as the
standard.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the chimpanzee may be said to
be exactly the same as that of man, but the assertion
must be qualified by a few facts which are of minor
importance, but since they are facts we cannot ignore
them.</p>

<p>The general plan, purpose and principle are the
same in each. There is no part of the one that is
not duplicated in the other, and there is no function
discharged by any part of the one that is not discharged
by the like part of the other. The chief
point in which they differ is in the structure of one
bone.</p>

<p>Near the base of the spinal column is a certain
bone called the <i class="anatomy">sacrum</i>. It is a constituent part of
the column, but in its singular form and structure
somewhat differs from the corresponding bone in
man. The general outline of this bone in the
plane of the hips is that of an isosceles triangle.
It fits in between the two large bones that spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
out towards the hips, and articulate with the thighbones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 329px;"><img id="i_005" src="images/i_005.jpg" width="329" height="321" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PELVIS OF CHIMPANZEE<br /></div>

<div class="in4">
<p class="in0 captionl">
A Sacrum.<br />
B Fourth lumbar vertebra.<br />
C Coccyx.<br />
D Ilium or hip-bone.<br />
E Femur or thigh-bone.
</p>
</div></div>

<p>About half-way from the centre to the edge, along
each side, is a row of four round holes. Across the
surface of the bone is a dim transverse line between
each pair of holes, from which it appears that five
smaller sections of the column have anchylosed or
grown into each other to form the <i class="anatomy">sacrum</i>, and the
holes coincide with the open spaces between the
lateral processes of the other bones of the column
above.</p>

<p>In the chimpanzee, this bone has the same general
form as in man, but instead of four holes in each
row it has five, connected by transverse lines in the
same way, indicating that six of the segments are
united instead of five; but to compensate for this
the ape has one vertebra less in the section of the
column just above it, in that portion called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<i class="anatomy">lumbar</i>. In it man has five, while the ape has but
four. But counting the whole number of bones in
the spinal column, and regarding each segment of
the <i class="anatomy">sacrum</i> as a distinct bone, which to all intents
it is, the sum of the bones in each column is exactly
the same.</p>

<p>Although this appears to be a fixed and constant
character, it cannot be esteemed as a matter of great
importance, since the same thing has been known to
occur in the human skeleton, and the reverse has
been known in some specimens of the apes, but has
never been observed in the chimpanzee. In this
respect he appears to be more constant than man so
far as we know at present.</p>

<p>As the greatest strains of the spinal column are
laid upon that part in which the <i class="anatomy">sacrum</i> is located,
there is a tendency for these segments to unite in
order to meet the demand, and since there is the
least flexure in that part, the cartilages that lie
between them ossify and become rigid. The erect
posture of man allows more room in the loins for the
fifth vertebra to move, and thus it is prevented from
uniting with the segment below it, which is held
firmly in place by the two large bones mentioned,
while the crouching habit of the ape presses that
vertebra firmly against the other, confining it between
the two large bones and thus reducing its
movement, wherefore the same result follows as with
the other sections below.</p>

<p>Another bone that may be said to differ in
structure is that known as the <i class="anatomy">sternum</i> or breastbone;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
it is the thin, soft bone to which the ribs are
joined in the front of the body. In the young of
both man and ape it is a mere cartilage which slowly
ossifies from the top downward. The process
appears to begin at different centres, the largest
nucleus being at the top. There appear to be five
of these centres. The bone never becomes quite
hard in either man or ape, but always remains somewhat
porous, and even in advanced age the outline
of the lower part is not defined by a smooth, sharp
line, but is irregular in contour and merges or blends
into the cartilages that hold the ribs in place.</p>

<p>In man, this bone in maturity is usually found in
two segments, while in the ape it varies. In some
specimens it is the same as in man, while in others
it is found to be in four or five segments. But the
<i class="anatomy">sternum</i> in each is always regarded as one bone, and
is developed from one continuous cartilage. The
separate parts are never considered distinct bones.
The reason that it is found in separate sections in
the ape is doubtless due to the stooping habit of the
animal, by which the bone is constantly flexed and
alternately straightened. In man this bone varies
to a great extent.</p>

<p>With these trifling exceptions in point of structures
alone, the skeletons of man and ape may be
truly said to be exact counterparts of each other,
having the same number of bones, of the same
general type arranged in the same order and articulated
in the same manner. The corresponding bone
in each is the same in design and purpose. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
frame of the ape is much more massive in its proportions
than that of man, but while this is true of
some kinds of ape the reverse is true of others. The
average height of the adult chimpanzee is about
63 inches.</p>

<p>In man the <i class="anatomy">sacrum</i> is more curved in the plane of
the hips than it is in the ape, while the bones of the
digits in man are straighter. The arms of man are
shorter than the legs, while in the ape these features
are reversed.</p>

<p>In the cranial types, it is readily seen that the
skull of man is nearly round and the face is vertical,
while the skull of the ape is elongated and the face
receding. These facts deserve more notice than the
mere mention of their being so.</p>

<p>In the whole scheme of nature certain laws obtain
in the projection of skulls. The angle between the
plane of the face and the spinal axis is co-ordinate
to the angle between the spinal axis and the perpendicular.</p>

<p>To be more exact, the spine of a snake is in a
horizontal line, and the face occupies a plane of the
same kind. At the other end of the scale is man,
whose spine is in a vertical line, and his face occupies
a like plane. Between these two extremes
are types which tend in various degrees, from the
lower to the higher form, and just in proportion as
the spinal axis approaches a vertical line from one
side, the plane of the face approaches it from the
other.</p>

<p>In accord with this fact it will be observed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the foramen or hole in the base of the skull through
which the spinal cord passes is adjusted closer and
closer to the centre of the base of the skull as the
spine becomes erect. In man, whose spinal column
is erect, the hole is in the centre of the base; in the
reptile, whose spine is horizontal, the hole is at the
extreme end of the base. In the ape the spinal axis
is at an angle with the vertical line, and the plane of
the face conforms to a similar one. In keeping with
this law it will be seen in all animals that just in the
same degree as the angles widen, the foramen is
removed from the centre of the base towards the
occiput.</p>

<p>It may be noted here, however, that the facial
angle is never exactly the same as the spinal angle.
The facial plane of the reptile is not quite horizontal,
nor that of man quite vertical, but the ratios of
angularity are constant. Even the habit of rearing
modifies to some extent this character, but it is only
the normal pose of the animal that determines the
exact limit of it.</p>

<p>In keeping with these facts it will be observed
that as the angle between the chin and the spine
widens, the lower jaws project, and the chin recedes
or flattens, and in a like degree the voice is modified.
The chin of man forms a right angle, but in the
reptile it is quite lost. In the former the vocal
powers are superior to that of all other animals, but
as we descend the scale they are reduced in scope
and degraded in quality, until in the lowest reptiles
they become a mere hiss or squeak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
By a careful study of the voices together with the
skulls of animals, it is found that the gnathic index
can be relied upon as a vocal index. The ape has
the smallest angle between the spinal axis and the
facial plane, and has the greatest vocal range and
purest voice of any other animal below man.
Among the apes the gibbon has the smallest angle,
and he also has the best vocal qualities of any other
ape.</p>

<p>The contour of the skull in all parts conforms to
the angle of its projection from the spinal axis. It
is depressed and elongated in proportion as the
angle increases: the brain cavity is narrowed in a
like proportion to its length, and the brain, of course,
is modified in the same manner.</p>

<p>The brain of the ape resembles that organ in
man as closely as his skeleton resembles man's. It
has the same lobes, convolutions, and centres. The
texture is slightly coarser. The small details are
less intricate and their lines somewhat less distinct.
But these also differ to a certain extent in different
men. In man and apes the same nerves are present
and connect the same organs of sensation, volition
and motion. In all essential points they are one.</p>

<p>These leading facts are deemed sufficient to show
the physical likeness of apes to man, and we shall
refrain from the minute details that would only be
of interest to the specialist. The purpose is to
acquaint the general reader with the leading facts.</p>

<p>Regarding man purely in the light of an animal,
it is evident that he is, physically, very closely allied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
to the chimpanzee, and that both are integral parts
of one great scheme of life, designed by the same
author, fashioned after the same model, projected
upon the same plan, and amenable to the same
system of vital economy. Viewing him in the light
of his physical nature, so far it is found that he does
not materially differ from other animals in the structure
of his skeleton and certain concomitants.</p>

<p>In the vital organs of the two there is perhaps
still greater unity of structure, and equal unity of
function in all essential details. The difference of
structure is only to the extent of making the organ
conform to the general plan of the animal, and the
difference of function is only one of degree. Since
the same characters vary quite as much among men
without changing their identity as such, it cannot be
sufficient ground to widen the hiatus between man
and ape; in fact, the physical likeness of the two
grows stronger as the comparison is extended into
more minute and scrutinising details. To the casual
observer the general resemblance is apparent, but to
the student the unity becomes evident.</p>

<p>In addition to the facts we have cited, the ape has
the same habits of rest and sleep; lives on the
same kind of diet, which is eaten and assimilated in
the same manner as with man; is subject to many
of the same diseases which attack the same organs,
and affect them in the same way as with man; he
suffers like pains and dies in the same manner as
man under like conditions.</p>

<p>The scope of this book is intended only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
embrace the chimpanzee and gorilla, but the comparison
which we have shown applies in the name
to all four of the anthropoid apes, but must be
qualified in a few instances to make it apply to the
others. These apes differ among themselves in
certain respects in form and habits, and we will
omit a detailed comparison of the monkeys as not
being relevant to the subject in hand; but it will not
be out of place to mention in a general way the chief
point in which they differ from men and apes.</p>

<p>There is no fixed type that will represent all kinds
of monkeys.</p>

<p>Within the limits of their own family they present
a great variety of types, but the one marked difference
between them as a unit, and the ape as another,
is, that the spinal column of the monkey is always
extended into a tail, the first vertebra of which is
joined to the base of the <i class="anatomy">sacrum</i>, while the ape has
no tail, but the spinal column terminates with a small
pointed bone called the coccyx, exactly the same as
in man. The number of bones and the number of
ribs in monkeys differ from those in the ape or
in man, and also vary among different types of
monkey.</p>

<p>There are many little shades and grades of
difference all along the line, but the unity of design
throughout the whole range of simian life is such as
to show a continuity of plan and purpose in all
essential details of the animal economy. With man
and ape the physical structures are one, so far as
they pertain to autonomy: their habits are one, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
far as they pertain to the means of life; their
faculties are one, so far as they pertain to the animal
polity, yet they may not be of a common stock.</p>

<p>The public mind does not seem to have grasped
the correct idea of evolution, and prejudice has
blinded, to some extent, the judgment. The common
opinion that man has descended from or is related
by consanguinity to a monkey is silly and absurd.
Science has never taught such folly, nor advanced
any theory from which such a conclusion could be
justly deduced. It would be a waste of time for me
to offer to explain the doctrine of evolution to any
one who does not already understand it from the
literature of others on this subject. If he still nurse
the idol of the identity of man and monkey, he must
be too obtuse or too perverse to be reclaimed. But
no one will deny the physical resemblance between
man and the great apes, and it is this resemblance
we seek to show rather than trace any relationship
based upon theories. It is not a matter that concerns
the purpose of this work, and we shall here
dismiss the subject by saying, that things may be
equivalent and yet not identical.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />

<span class="subhead">CAGED IN AN AFRICAN JUNGLE</span></h2>

<p>It may be of interest to the reader to know the
manner in which I have pursued the study of
monkeys in a state of nature, and the means employed
to that end. I shall therefore give a brief
outline of my life in a cage in the heart of an
African jungle in order to watch those denizens
of the forest, when free from all restraint.</p>

<p>After devoting much time for several years to the
study of the speech and habits of monkeys in
captivity, I formulated a plan of going into their
native haunts, to study them in a state of freedom.</p>

<p>In the course of my labours up to that time, I had
found out that monkeys of the highest physical type
had also a higher type of speech than those of
inferior kinds. In accord with this fact, it was
logical to infer that the anthropoid apes, being next
to man in the scale of nature, must have the faculty
of speech developed in a corresponding degree.</p>

<p>As the chief object of my studies was to learn the
language of monkeys, the great apes appeared to be
the best subjects for that purpose, so I turned my
attention to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
The gorilla was said to be the most like man, and
the chimpanzee next. There were none of the
former in captivity, and but few of the latter, and
they were kept under conditions that forbade all
efforts to do anything in that line.</p>

<p>As the gorilla and chimpanzee could both be
found in the same section of tropical Africa, I
selected that as the field of operation, and began to
prepare for a journey there to carry out the task I
had assumed.</p>

<p>The part selected was along the equator, and
south of it, about two degrees. The locality is
infested with fevers, insects, serpents and wild
beasts of divers kinds. To ignore such dangers
would be folly, but there was no way to see these
apes in their freedom, except to go and live among
them.</p>

<p>To lessen, in a degree, the dangers incurred by
such an adventure, I devised a cage of steel wire,
woven into a lattice with a mesh one inch and a
half wide. This was made in twenty-four panels,
three feet three inches square, set in a frame of
narrow iron strips. Each side of the panels was
provided with half-hinges, so arranged as to fit any
side of every other panel. These could be quickly
bolted together with small iron rods, and, when so
bolted, formed a cage of cubical shape, six feet six
inches square.</p>

<p>Any one or more of the panels could be
swung open as a door, and the whole structure
was painted a dingy green, so that when erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
in the forest it was almost invisible among the
foliage.</p>

<p>While it was not strong enough to withstand a
prolonged siege, it afforded a certain immunity from
being surprised by the fierce and stealthy beasts of
the jungle, and would allow the occupant time to kill
an assailant before the wires would yield to an attack
from anything except an elephant. Of course it was
no protection against them, but as they rarely ever
attack a man unless provoked to it, there was little
danger from that source; besides, there were not
many of those huge brutes in the immediate part in
which my strange domicile was set up.</p>

<p>Through this open fabric one could see without
obstruction on all sides, and yet feel a certain
sense of safety from being devoured by leopards or
panthers.</p>

<p>Over this frail fortress was a roof of bamboo
leaves, and it was provided with curtains of canvas
to be hung up in case of rain. The floor was of
thin boards, steeped in tar, and the structure was set
up about two feet from the ground, on nine small
posts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 473px;"><img id="i_017" src="images/i_017.jpg" width="473" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">WAITING AND WATCHING IN THE CAGE</div></div>

<p>It was furnished with a bed, made of heavy
canvas supported by two poles of bamboo, attached
to the edge of it. One of these poles was lashed
fast to the side of the cage, and the other was
suspended at night by strong wire hooks, hung
on the top of it. During the day, the bed was
rolled up on one of the poles, so that it was out
of the way. I had a light camp chair, which folded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
up, and a table was improvised by a broad, short
board hung on wires. This could be set up by the
wall of the cage at night, out of the way. To this
meagre outfit was added a small kerosene stove, and
a swinging shelf.</p>

<p>A few tin cases contained my wearing apparel,
blanket, pillow, photograph camera and supplies,
medicines, and an ample store of canned meats,
crackers, &amp;c. A magazine rifle, revolver, ammunition,
and a few useful tools, such as a hammer, saw,
pliers, files, and a heavy bush-knife, completed my
stock, except some tin platters, cups and spoons.
These served in cooking, and also for the table,
instead of dishes.</p>

<p>With this equipment I sailed from New York on
the 9th of July 1892, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">viâ</i> England, to the port of
Gaboon, the site of the colonial government of the
French Congo. This place is within a few miles of
the equator, and near the borders of the country in
which the gorilla lives. I arrived there on the 18th
of October of the same year, and after a delay of
a few weeks I set out to find the object of my
search.</p>

<p>Leaving this place, I went up the Ogowe River
about two hundred miles, and through the lake
region on the south side of it. After some weeks of
travel and inquiry, I arrived at the lake of Ferran
Vaz, in the territory of the Nkami tribe. The lake
is about thirty miles long, by eight or ten wide, and
interspersed with a few islands of large size, covered
with a dense growth of tropical vegetation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
country around the lake is mostly low and marshy,
traversed by creeks, lagoons and rivers. Most of
the land is covered by a deep and dreary jungle,
with a few sandy plains at intervals.</p>

<p>In the depths of this gloomy forest, reeking with
the effluvia of decaying plants, and teeming with
insect life, the gorilla dwells in safety and seclusion.
In the same forest the chimpanzee makes his abode,
but is less timid and retiring.</p>

<p>On the south side of this lake, not quite two
degrees below the equator, and within some twenty
miles of the ocean, I selected a place in the heart of
the primeval forest, erected my little fortress, and
gave it the name of <i>Fort Gorilla</i>.</p>

<p>In the latter part of April 1893, I took up my
abode in this desolate spot, and began my long and
solitary vigil.</p>

<p>My sole companion was a young chimpanzee, that
I named Moses, and, from time to time, a native boy,
as a servant.</p>

<p>Seated in this cage, in the silence of the great
forest, I have seen the gorilla in all his majesty,
strolling at leisure through his sultry domain, in
quest of food. I have seen the chimpanzee under
like conditions, and the happy, chattering monkey in
the freedom of his jungle home.</p>

<p>In this novel hermitage I remained for the greater
part of the time for one hundred and twelve days and
nights in succession, watching these animals in perfect
freedom following the pursuits of their daily life.</p>

<p>With such an experience, I will not be charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
with vanity in saying that I have seen more of those
animals in a state of nature than any white man ever
saw, and under conditions more favourable for a
careful study of their manners and habits, than
could otherwise be possible. Hence, what I have
to say concerning them is the result of an experience
which no other man can claim.</p>

<p>I do not mean to ignore or impugn what others
have said on this subject, but the sum of my
labours in this field leads me to doubt much that
has been said and accepted as true. I regret that
it devolves upon me to controvert many stories
told about these great apes, but finding no germ
of truth in some of them, I cannot evade the duty
of denying them. I regret it all the more, because
many of them have been woven into the fabric of
natural history, and marked with the seal of scientific
approval; but time will sustain me in the denial.</p>

<p>I am aware that bigots of certain schools will
challenge me for pointing out their mistakes, and
some will assume to know more about these apes
than a fish knows about swimming; but truth defies
all theory.</p>

<p>Each kind of ape will be treated in the chapter
devoted to it, but only those with which I have
dealt in person will be discussed at length. Others
will be noticed, in order to sustain the continuity of
the subject and show the relative planes of those
under consideration. But before proceeding with
the monkeys, I shall pause to relate some of the
incidents of my hermitage.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<span class="subhead">DAILY LIFE AND SCENES IN THE JUNGLE</span></h2>

<p>I am so frequently asked about the details of my
daily life in the cage, how the time was occupied
and what I saw besides the apes, that I deem it of
interest to relate a few of the events of my sojourn
in this wild spot.</p>

<p>In order to convey an idea of it, I shall relate the
incidents of a single day and night; but of course
the routine varied in some degree from day to
day.</p>

<p>At six o'clock, as the sun first peeps into the
forest, it finds me with a tin cup of coffee, just made
on the little kerosene stove. It is black and dreggy,
but with a little sugar it is not bad. With a few
dry crackers I break my fast of twelve hours, and
am ready for the task before me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;"><img id="i_023" src="images/i_023.jpg" width="470" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">STARTING FOR A STROLL</div></div>

<p>In the meantime the boy rolls up my bed and his
mat. By this time Moses has helped himself to a
banana or two. Then I take my rifle, he climbs up
on my shoulder, and we go for a short walk in the
bush, while the boy sweeps out the cage and puts
everything in order for the day. When we return,
the boy, armed with a native spear, or a huge knife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
takes the big jug, and goes to a spring, about three
hundred yards away, for a supply of water.</p>

<p>Then Moses is allowed to climb about in the
bushes and amuse himself; the boy sits down, or
goes to his village a mile away, while I watch for
gorillas. Silence is the order of the day, and here
I sit, sometimes for hours alone, almost as quiet as a
tomb.</p>

<p>Presently a rustle of the leaves is heard, and a
porcupine comes waddling into view. He is poking
his nose about, in search of food, but has not
discovered my presence. He comes closer, until
the scent or sight of me startles him, and away he
goes. By-and-by a civet cat comes stealing through
the bush, till he observes me, and hastily departs.</p>

<p>After an hour of patient waiting the sound of
clashing boughs is heard in the tree-tops. A few
minutes later may be seen a big school of monkeys,
led by a solemn-looking old pilot, who doubtless
knows every palm that bears nuts within twenty
miles around. They are now coming to inspect
my cage, and see what new thing this is, set up in
monkeydom.</p>

<p>As they come nearer, they become more cautious
and tardy. They find a strong bough in the top of
a big tree, and the grave old pilot perches himself
far out on it, to peep at my cage. Just behind him
sits the next in rank, resting his hands on the
shoulders of the leader, while a dozen more are
arranged in similar attitudes behind each other,
along the limb. Each one pushes the one just in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
front of him, to make him move up a little closer,
but no one of them, except the pilot, seems to want
the front seat.</p>

<p>They look in silence, turning their little heads
from side to side, as if to be certain it is not an
illusion. They nudge one another again, and move
up an inch or two closer, squinting their bright eyes,
as if in doubt about the strange sight before them.
They have made such calls before, but have not
quite determined what kind of an animal this is in
the cage. At each successive visit they come a
little nearer, until now they are not a hundred feet
away. Now they take alarm at something, and hurry
away in another direction.</p>

<p>Next comes an armadillo, prowling about for
insects among the leaves. He catches a glimpse of
the cage, he stands motionless for a moment, to see
what it is, and then, like a flash, he is gone.</p>

<p>During this time birds of divers kinds have been
flying in all directions. Some of them perch on the
limbs near by, some pick the nuts of the palm-tree,
while others scream and screech, like so
many tin-whistles, or brass horns. Many of them
are parrots. Some have brilliant and beautiful
plumage.</p>

<p>It is now ten o'clock. Not a breath of air stirs a
leaf of the whole forest. The heat is sweltering and
oppressive. The voices of the birds grow less and
less frequent. Even the insects do not appear to be
so busy as they were in the earlier hours of the day.
Moses has abandoned his rambles in the bush, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
sits on a fallen tree, with his arms folded, as if he
had finished work for the day.</p>

<p>Along towards this hour everything in the forest
appears to become quiet and inactive, and continues
so until about two o'clock in the afternoon. I was
impressed on more than one occasion with this
universal rest during the hottest part of the day, and
the same thing seems to prevail among the aquatic
animals.</p>

<p>I now prepare my repast for midday, by opening
a can of meat or fish, and warming it in a tin plate
on the little stove. I have no vegetables or dessert,
but with a few crackers broken up, and stirred into
the grease, and plenty of water to drink with it, I
find it an ample meal. When it is finished, Moses
coils up in his little hammock, swung by my side,
and takes his siesta. The boy, when there, stretches
out on the floor, and does likewise.</p>

<p>During the hours from ten till two, few things are
astir, though I have seen some interesting sights
during that time.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the change is sudden
at these periods, for such is not the case. It is not a
fixed time for everything to cease its activity. It is
by slow degrees that one after another becomes
quiescent, until life appears almost extinct for a time;
but as the sun begins to descend the western sky,
things begin to revive, and by three o'clock everything
is again astir.</p>

<p>Now a lone gorilla comes stalking through the
bush, looking for the red fruit of the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">batuna</i> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
grows at the root of the plant. He plucks a bud of
some kind, tears it apart with his fingers, smells it,
and throws it aside. Now he takes hold of a tall
sapling, looks up at the shaking branches, and turns
aside. He pauses and looks around as if suspicious
of danger. He listens to see if anything is approaching,
but being reassured he resumes his search for
food. Now he gently parts the tangled vines that
intercept his way, and creeps noiselessly through
them. He hesitates, looks carefully around him,
and then proceeds again. He is coming this way.
I can see his black face as he turns his head from
side to side, looking for food. What a brutal
visage! It has a scowl upon it, as if he were at odds
with all his race. He is now within a few yards of
the cage, but is not aware of my presence. He
plucks the tendril from a vine, smells it, and puts it
in his mouth. He plucks another and another. I
shall note that vine, and ascertain what it is. Now
he is in a small open space, where the bush is cut
away, so as to afford a better view. He seems to
know that this is an unusual thing to find in the
jungle, so he surveys it with caution. He comes
nearer. Now he has detected me. He sits down
upon the ground, and looks at me as if in utter
surprise. A moment more he turns aside, looks
back over his shoulders, but hurries away into the
dense jungle.</p>

<p>It is now four o'clock, and I hear a wild pig
rooting among the fallen leaves. I see a small
rodent that looks like a diminutive hedgehog. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
is gnawing the bark from a dead limb, possibly to
capture some insect secreted under it; but as rodents
usually live upon vegetable diet, he may have some
other reason for this.</p>

<p>It is five o'clock, and the shadows are beginning
to deepen in the forest. I see two little grey
monkeys playing in the top of a very tall tree. The
birds are tiresome and monotonous. Yonder is a
small snake twined around the limb of a bushy tree.
He is doubtless hunting for a nest of young birds.
The low, muttering sound of distant thunder is
heard, but little by little it grows louder. It is the
familiar voice of the tornado. I must prepare
for it.</p>

<p>The stove is now lighted, and a pie-pan of water
set on it. In it is stirred an ounce of desiccated
soup. It is heated to the boiling-point, and then
set on the swinging table. Then a can of mutton
is emptied into another pan of the same kind, and a
few crackers broken and stirred in. The soup is
eaten while the meat is being cooked. When it is
ready, the flame of the stove is turned off, and the
second course of dinner is served, consisting of
canned mutton, crackers and water. The dishes,
consisting usually of three tin pie-pans and a cup,
are thrust out into the adjacent bush, for the ants
and other insects to clean during the night.</p>

<p>In the meantime Moses has had his supper, and
gone to his own little cage, to find shelter from the
approaching storm. The curtains are hung up on
the side of the cage, from which the tornado is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
coming. Now the leaves begin to rustle. It is the
first cool breath of the day, but it is only the herald
of the furious wind that is rapidly advancing. The
tree-tops begin to sway. Now they are lashing each
other as if in anger; the strong trees are bending
from the wind; the lightning is so vivid that it is
blinding; the thunder is terrific. One shaft after
another, the burning bolts are hurled through the
moaning forest. The roar of thunder is unceasing.
I hear the dull thud of a falling tree, while the
crackling boughs are falling all around me. The
rain is pouring in torrents, and all nature is in a
rage. Every bird and beast has sought a place of
refuge from the warring elements. No sign of life
is visible, no sound is audible, save the voice of the
storm.</p>

<p>How unspeakably desolate the jungle is at such
an hour, no fancy can depict. How utterly helpless
a human being is against the wrath of nature, no
one can realise, except to live through such an hour
in such a place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;"><img id="i_031" src="images/i_031.jpg" width="436" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PREPARING FOR THE NIGHT</div></div>

<p>On one occasion five large trees were blown down,
within a radius of two hundred yards of my cage,
and scores of limbs were broken off by the wind,
and scattered like straws. Some of them were six
or eight inches in diameter, and ten or twelve feet
long. One of them broke the corner off the bamboo
roof over my cage. The limb was broken off a
huge cotton-tree near by, and fell from a height of
about sixty feet. It was carried by the wind some
yards out of a vertical line as it fell, and just passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
far enough to spare my cage. Had it struck the
body of it, no doubt it would have been partly demolished,
for the main body of the bough was about
six inches in diameter and ten feet long. This particular
tornado lasted for nearly three hours, and was
the most violent of any I saw during the entire year.</p>

<p>Now the storm subsides, but the darkness is impenetrable.
I have no light of any kind, for that
would alarm the inhabitants of the jungle, and
attract a vast army of insects from all quarters.
Moses and the boy are fast asleep, while I sit and
listen to the many strange and weird sounds heard
in the jungle at night The bush crackles near by.
It is a leopard creeping through it. He is coming
this way. Slowly, cautiously he approaches. I cannot
see him in the deep shadows of the foliage, but
I can locate him by sound, and identify him by his
peculiar tread. Perhaps he will attack the cage
when he gets near enough. He is creeping up
closer. He evidently smells his prey, and is bent on
seizing it.</p>

<p>My rifle stands by my elbow. I silently raise it,
and lay it across my lap. The brute is now crouching
within a few yards of me, but I cannot see to
shoot him. I hear him move again, as if adjusting
himself to spring upon the cage. He cannot see it,
but he has located me by scent. I hear a low rustling
of the leaves as he wags his tail preparatory to
a leap. If I could only touch a button and turn on
a bright electric light over his head! He remains
crouching near, while I sit with the muzzle of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
rifle turned towards him, and my hand on the lock.
It is a trying moment. If he should spring with
such force as to break the frail network that is
between us, there could be but one fate for me.</p>

<p>In the brief space of a few seconds a thousand
things run through one's mind. Not prompted by
fear, but by suspense. Is it best to fire into the
black shadows, or to wait for his attack? What is
his exact pose? What does he intend? How big
is he? Can he see me? And a category of similar
questions arise at this critical moment.</p>

<p>A clash of bushes, and he is gone. Not with the
stealthy, cautious steps with which he advanced, but
in hot haste. He has taken alarm, abandoned his
purpose, and far away I can hear the dry twigs
crashing as he hurries to some remote nook. He
flees as if he thought he was being pursued. He is
gone, and I feel a sense of relief.</p>

<p>It is ten o'clock, the low rumbling of distant
thunder is all that remains of the tornado that swept
over me a few hours ago. The stars are shining,
but the foliage of the forest is so dense, that I can
only see one here and there, peeping through the
tangled boughs overhead. I hear some little waif
among the dead leaves, but what it is, or what it
wants, can only be surmised.</p>

<p>Another hour is passed, and I retire to my hammock.
The sounds of nocturnal birds are fewer
now. I hear a strange, tremulous sound up in the
boughs of the bushes near the cage. It sounds like
the leaves vibrating. It ceases, and begins again at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
intervals. I listen with attention, for it is very
singular. It is a huge python in search of birds.
He reaches his head and neck forward, grasps the
bough of a slender bush, releases his coil from
another, and by contraction draws his slimy body
forward. The pliant boughs yield to his heavy
weight. The abrasion causes it to tremble, and the
leaves to quake.</p>

<p>I fall asleep and rest in comfort, while the dew
that has fallen on the leaves gathers itself into huge
drops, their weight bends the leaves, and they fall
from their lofty perch, striking those far below with
a sharp, popping sound. The hours fly by, but in
the stillness of the early morning is heard a most
unearthly scream. It is a king gorilla. He simply
makes every leaf in the forest tremble with the
sound of his piercing shrieks.</p>

<p>The dawn again awakes to life the teeming forest,
and all its denizens again go forth to join the universal
chase for food.</p>

<p>All of these incidents cited are true in every
detail, but they did not occur every day, nor did all
of them occur on the same day, as would be inferred
from the manner in which they are related.</p>

<p>This gives a glimpse of my real daily life in the
jungle, but the monotony was often relieved by
going out for a day or two at a time, or hunting on
the plains, a few miles away. My menu was occasionally
varied by a chicken, piece of goat, fish or
porcupine; but the general average of it was about
as described.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE CHIMPANZEE</span></h2>

<p>Next to man, the chimpanzee occupies the highest
plane in the scale of nature. His mental and social
traits, together with his physical type, assign him to
this place.</p>

<p>In his distribution, he is confined to Equatorial
Africa. His habitat, roughly outlined, is from the
fourth parallel north of the equator to the fifth
parallel south of it, along the west coast, and extends
eastward about half-way across the continent. His
range can be defined with more precision, but its
exact limits are not quite certain. Its boundary on
the north is defined by the Kameroon valley, slightly
curving to the north, but its extent eastward is not
well known. He does not appear to be found
anywhere north of this river, and it is quite certain
that the few specimens attributed to the north coast
of the Gulf of Guinea do not belong to that territory.
On the south, its boundary starts from the coast, at
a point near the fifth parallel, curves northward,
crossing the Congo near Stanley Pool, pursues a
north-east course, to the centre of the Congo State,
again curves southward, across the Upper Congo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
towards the north end of Lake Tanganyika. Its
limits appear to conform more to isothermal lines,
than to the rigid lines of geometry.</p>

<p>Specimens are sometimes secured by collectors
beyond the limits mentioned, but so far as I can
ascertain they appear to have been captured within
these limits. There are numerous centres of population.
This ape is not strictly confined to any definite
topography, but occupies the upland forests or the
low basin lands.</p>

<p>In one section he is known to the natives by one
name, and in another by quite a different one. The
name <i class="classification">chimpanzee</i> is of native origin. In the Fiot
tongue the name of the ape is <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">chimpan</i>, which is a
slight corruption of the true name. It is properly a
compound word, the first syllable is from the Fiot
word <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">tyi</i>, which white men erroneously pronounce
like "chee." It means "small," and is found in
many of the native compounds. The latter syllable
is from <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">mpâ</i>, a bushman, hence the word literally
means, in the Fiot tongue, "a small bushman."</p>

<p>Among other tribes the common name of the ape
is <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">ntyigo</i>. The two names appear to come from the
same ultimate source. The latter is derived from
the Mpongwe word <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ntyia</i>, blood, hence breed, and
the word <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">iga</i>, the forest, and literally means the
"breed of the forest." The same idea is involved in
the two names, and both convey the oblique idea
that the animal is something more like man than
other animals are.</p>

<p>There are two distinct types of this ape, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
are now regarded as two species. One of them is
distributed throughout the entire habitat described,
while the other is only known south of the equator,
between the second and fifth parallels, and west of
the Congo. Both kinds are found within these
limits, but the variety which is confined to that
region is called, by the tribes that know the ape, the
<i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu-kamba</i>, in contradistinction to the other kind,
known as <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ntyigo</i>. This name is derived from <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu</i>,
the onomotope of the sound made by the animal and
the native verb <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kamba</i>, to speak, hence the name
literally means the thing "that speaks kulu."</p>

<p>In certain points the common variety differs from
the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu-kamba</i> in a degree that would indicate that
they belong to distinct species, but the skulls and
skeletons are so nearly the same, that no one can
identify them with certainty. In life, however, it is
not difficult to distinguish them.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ntyigo</i> has a longer face and more prominent
nose than the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu</i>. His complexion is of all shades
of brown, from a light tan to a dark, dingy mummy
colour. He has a thin coat of short black hair,
which is often described as brown, but that effect is
due to the colour of his skin blending with that of
his suit. In early life his hair is quite black, but in
advanced age the ends are tipped with a dull white,
giving him a dingy grey colour. The change is due
to the same causes that produce grey hairs on the
human body. But there is one point in which they
differ. The entire hair of the human becomes white
with age, while only the end of it does so in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
chimpanzee. In the human, one hair becomes white,
while another retains its natural colour, but in this
ape all the hairs appear to undergo the same
change.</p>

<p>In very aged specimens the outer part of the hair
often assumes a dirty, brownish colour, which is due
to the want of vascular action to supply the colour
pigment, and the same effect is often seen in preserved
specimens, for the same reason that the hair
of an Egyptian mummy is brown, while in life it was
doubtless a jet black. In this ape the hair is uniformly
black, except the small tuft of white at the
base of the spinal column and a few white hairs on
the lower lip and chin. I have examined about sixty
living specimens and I have never found any other
colour among them only from the cause mentioned.
The normal colour of both sexes is the same.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu</i>, as a rule, has but little hair on the top
of its head, but that on the back of it and on the
neck is much longer than elsewhere on the body, and
longer on them than on other apes.</p>

<p>Much stress is laid by some writers on the bald
head of one ape and the parted hair on that of
another. These features cannot be relied upon as
having any specific meaning, unless there are as
many species as there are apes. Sometimes a
specimen has no hair on the summit of its head,
while another differs from it in this respect alone by
having a suit of hair more or less dense, and yet in
every other respect they are the same. Some of
them have the hair growing almost down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
eyebrows, and each hair appears to diverge from a
common centre like the radii of a sphere: another of
the same species will have the hair parted in the
middle as neatly as if it had been combed, while
another may have it in wild disorder. The same
thing is noticed in certain monkeys, and it is equally
true of the human being. As a factor in classifying
them it signifies nothing. It may be remarked that
as a whole the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu</i> is inclined to have little hair
upon the crown of the head.</p>

<p>Between the two species there is a close alliance,
but the males differ more than the females. This is
especially true in the structure of certain organs.</p>

<p>The face in youth is quite free from hairs, but in
the adult state there is, in both sexes, a slight tendency
to grow a light down over the cheeks.</p>

<p>The colour of the skin is not uniform in all parts
of the body, especially on the face. Some specimens
have patches of dark colour set in a lighter ground.
Sometimes certain parts of the face will be dark, and
other parts light. I have seen one specimen quite
freckled.</p>

<p>It is said by some that the skin is light in colour
when young, and becomes darker with age, but such
is not the case. It is true that the skin darkens a
few shades as the cuticle hardens, but there is no
transition from one colour to another, and this slight
change of shade is only on the exposed parts.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu</i> has a short, round face, very much like
that of a human. In early life it is quite free from
hairs, but, like the other, a slight down appears with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
age. He has a heavy suit of hair on the body. It
is coarser than that of the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ntyigo</i>, longer, and inclined
to wave, giving it a fluffy aspect. The colour
is jet black, except a small tuft of white about the
base of the spine.</p>

<p>The skin varies in colour less than in the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ntyigo</i>,
and the darker shades seldom appear. The eyes
are a shade darker, and in both species the parts of
the eye which are white in man are brown in the
chimpanzee, gradually shading off into a yellow near
the base of the optic nerve. As a rule, the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu</i> has
a clear, open visage, with a kindly expression. It is
confiding and affectionate to a degree beyond any
other animal. It is more intelligent than its <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confrère</i>,
and displays the faculty of reason almost like a human
being.</p>

<p>One important point in which these apes differ is
in the scope and quality of voice. The <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu</i> makes
a greater range of vocal sounds than the other.
Some of them are soft and musical, while those
uttered by the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ntyigo</i> are fewer in number and
more harsh in quality. One of them resembles the
bark of a dog, and another is a sharp screaming
sound.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu</i> evinces a certain sense of gratitude,
while the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ntyigo</i> appears to be almost devoid of this
instinct. There are many traits in which they differ,
but human beings, of the same family, also differ in
these qualities.</p>

<p>The points in which they coincide are many, and
after a brief review of them, we may consider the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
question of making two species of them, or assigning
them to the same.</p>

<p>The skeletons, as we have noted, are the same in
form, size and proportion. Their muscular, nervous,
and veinous systems are the same, except a slight
structural variation in the genital organs of the
males, and the degree of mobility in certain facial
muscles. The character of their food, and the mode
of eating it, are the same in each. In captivity they
appear to regard each other as one of their own
kind, but whether they mate or not remains to be
learned.</p>

<p>Such is the sum of the likenesses and differences
between the two extreme types of this genus; but
with so many points in common, and so few in which
they differ, it is a matter of serious doubt whether
they can be said to constitute two distinct species,
or only two marked varieties of a common species.
This doubt is further emphasised by the fact that all
the way between these two extremes are many gradations
of intermediate types, so that it is next to
impossible to say where one ends and the other
begins.</p>

<p>In view of all these facts, I believe them to be two
well-defined varieties of the same species; they are
the white man and the negro of a common stock.
They are the patrician and plebeian of one race, or
the nobility and yeomanry of one tribe. They are
like different phases of the same moon. The <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kulu-kamba</i>
is simply a high order of chimpanzee.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;"><img id="i_043" src="images/i_043.jpg" width="495" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">IN THE JUNGLE</div></div>

<p>It is quite true that two varieties of one species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
usually have the same vocal characteristics, and this
appears to be the strongest point in favour of
assigning them to separate species, but it is not
impossible that even this may be waived.</p>

<p>Leaving this question for others to decide, as they
find the evidence to sustain them, we shall, for the
present, regard them as one kind, and consider their
physical, social and mental status.</p>

<p>Whether they be all of one species, or divided
into many, the same habits, traits, and modes of life
prevail throughout the entire group, so that one
description will apply to all, so far as we have to
deal with them in general. There are many incidents
to be related elsewhere, which apply to
individuals of the special kinds mentioned, but for
the present the term chimpanzee is meant to include
the whole group, except where it may be otherwise
specified.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />

<span class="subhead">PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, AND MENTAL QUALITIES</span></h2>

<p>Physically, the chimpanzee, as we have seen,
closely resembles man, but there are certain points
that have not been mentioned in which he differs
from him, also from other apes. We may here take
note of a few of those points.</p>

<p>The model and structure of the ear of this ape are
somewhat the same as those of man, but the organ is
larger in size, and thinner in proportion. It is very
sensitive to sound, but dull to the touch, indicating
that the surface is not well provided with nerves.
He cannot move it as other animals move theirs by
the use of the muscles at its base, but, like the
human ear, it is quite fixed and helpless in this
respect.</p>

<p>The hand of the chimpanzee is long and narrow.
The finger bones are longer, in proportion to their
size, than those of the human hand, and slightly
more curved in the plane of the digits. One thing
peculiar in the hand of the chimpanzee, is that the
tendons inside of the hand, which are called the
flexors, and designed to close the fingers, are shorter
than the line of the bones, and on this account the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
fingers of the ape are always held in a curve, so that
he cannot possibly straighten them into a line.
This is probably due to the habit of climbing in
which he indulges to a great extent; also to the
practice of hanging by the hands. In making his
way through the bush, he often swings from bough
to bough by the arms alone, and sometimes suspends
himself by one arm, while he uses the other
to pluck and eat fruit. This characteristic is transmitted
to the young, and is found in the first stages
of infancy. The thumb is not truly opposable, but
is inclined to close towards the palm of the hand.
It is of little use to him. His nails are thick, dark
in colour, and not so flat as those of man.</p>

<p>Instead of having the great toe in line with the
others, it projects at an angle from the side of the
foot, something after the manner of the human
thumb. The foot itself is flexible, and has great
prehensile power. In climbing, and in many
other ways, it is used as a hand. The tendons in
the sole of the foot are equal in length to the
line of the bones, and the digits of the foot can be
straightened, but both members are inclined to
curve into an arch in the line of the first and second
digits.</p>

<p>His habit of walking is peculiar. The greater
part of the weight is borne upon the legs. The
sole of the foot is placed almost flat on the ground,
but the pressure is greatest along the outer edge of
it, in the line of the last digit. This is easily noticed
where he walks through plastic ground. In the act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
of walking he always uses the hands, but does not
place the palm on the ground; he uses the backs of
the fingers instead, sometimes only the first joints
are placed on the ground, resting on the nails; at
other times the first and second joints are used,
while at others the backs of all the fingers from the
knuckles to the nails serve as a base for the arm.
The integument on these parts is not callous, like
that of the palm; the colour pigment is distributed
the same as on other exposed parts of the body,
which shows that the weight of the body is not
borne on the fore limbs, as it is in the case of a true
quadruped, but indicates that the hand is only used
to balance the body and shift the weight from foot to
foot, while in the act of walking. The weight is
not equally distributed between the hands and the
feet.</p>

<p>His waddling gait is caused by his short legs,
stooping habit and heavy body. All bipeds with
stout bodies and short legs are predisposed to a
waddling motion, which is due to the wide angle
between the weight and the changing centre of
gravity.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee is neither a true quadruped, nor
a true biped, but combines the habits of both. It
appears to be a transition state from the former to
the latter, and a vestige of this habit is still to be
found in man, whose arms alternate in motion with
his legs in the act of walking, which suggests the
idea that he may, at some time, have had a similar
habit of locomotion. Such a fact does not show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
that he was ever an ape, but it does point to the
belief that he has once occupied a like horizon in
nature to that now occupied by the ape, and that
having emerged from it, he still retains traces of the
habit.</p>

<p>This peculiarity is still more easily observed in
children than in adults. In early infancy all children
are inclined to be bow-legged, and in their first
efforts at walking, invariably press most of their
weight on the outer edge of the foot, and curve the
toes inward, as if to grasp the surface on which the
foot is placed. The instinct to prehension cannot
be mistaken; it differs in degree in different races,
and is vastly more pronounced in negro than in
white infants.</p>

<p>There is another peculiar feature in the walk of
the chimpanzee. The motion of the arms and legs
do not alternate with the same degree of regularity
that they do in man or quadrupeds. This ape uses
his arms more like crutches. They are moved forward,
not quite, but almost at the same instant, and
the motion of the legs is not at equal intervals. To
be more explicit: the hands are placed almost opposite
each other; the right foot is advanced about
three times its length; the left foot placed about one
length in front of it; the arms are again moved; the
right foot again advanced about three lengths forward
of the left; and the left again brought about
one length in front of it. The same animal does
not always use the same foot to make the long
stride. It will be seen by this that each foot moves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
through the same space, and that in a line, the
tracks of either foot are the same distance apart, but
the distance from the track of the right foot to that
of the left is about three times as great as the distance
from the track of the left foot to that of the
right; or the reverse may be the case. The distance
from the track of either foot to the succeeding track
of the other, is never the same between the right
and left tracks, except where the animal is walking
at great leisure.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no animal more awkward than
the chimpanzee, when he attempts to run. He
sometimes swings his body with such force between
his arms as to lose his balance, and falls backward
on the ground. I have often seen him do this, and
when he would right himself again, would be half
his length farther backward than forward of his
starting-point.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee is doubtless a better climber
than the gorilla. He finds much of his food in
trees, but is not arboreal in habit in the proper sense
of that term. To be arboreal, the animal must sleep
in trees or on a perch, but the chimpanzee cannot
do so. He sleeps the same as a human being does.
He lies down on the back or side, and, as a rule,
uses his arms for a pillow. I do not believe it possible
for him to sleep on a perch. He may sometimes
doze in that way, but the grasp of his foot is
only brought into use when he is conscious of it. I
have often known Moses to climb down from the
trees and lie upon the ground to take a nap. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
never even saw him so much as doze in any other
position.</p>

<p>I may here call attention to one fact concerning
the arboreal habit. There appears to be a rule to
which this habit conforms. Among apes and
monkeys the habit is in keeping with the size of the
animal. The largest monkeys, as a rule, are only
found among the lowest trees, and the smaller
monkeys among the taller trees. It is a rare thing
ever to see a large monkey in the top of a tall tree.
He may venture there for food or to make his
escape, but it is not his proper element. This same
rule appears to hold good among the apes themselves.
The gibbon has this habit in a more pronounced
degree than any other true ape. The
orang appears to be next; the chimpanzee then
comes in for a third place, and the gorilla last. It
must not be understood that all of these apes do not
frequently climb, even to the tops of the highest
trees; but that is not their normal mode of life any
more than the top of a mast is the proper place on a
ship for a sailor.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee is nomadic in habit, and, like the
gorilla, seldom or never passes two nights in the
same spot. As to his building huts or nests in trees
or elsewhere, I am not prepared to believe that he
ever does so. I hunted in vain, for months, and
made diligent inquiry in several tribes, but failed to
find a specimen of any kind of shelter built by an
ape. I do not assert that it is absolutely untrue, but
I have never been able to obtain any evidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
except the statement of the natives that it was true.
On the contrary, certain facts point to the opposite
belief. If the ape built him a permanent home the
natives would soon discover it, and there would be
no difficulty in having it pointed out. If he built a
new one every night, however rude and primitive it
might be there would be so many of them in the
forest that there would be no difficulty in finding
them. The nomadic habit plainly shows that he
does not build the former kind, and the utter absence
of them shows that he does not build the
latter kind, and the whole story appears to be without
foundation.</p>

<p>In addition to these facts, one thing to be noticed
is that few or none of the mammals of the tropics
ever build any kind of a home. Even the animals
that have the habit of burrowing in other climates,
do not appear to do so in the tropics. This is due,
no doubt, to the warm climate, in which they are
not in need of shelter. Of course birds, and other
oviperous animals, build nests, as they do elsewhere.</p>

<p>The longevity of these apes is largely a matter of
conjecture, but from a cursory study of their dentition
and other factors of their development, it
appears that the male reaches the adult stage at an
age ranging from nine to eleven years, while the
female matures at six or seven. These appear to be
the periods at which they pass from the state of
adolescence. Some of them live to be perhaps forty
years of age, or upwards, but the average of life is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
doubtless not more than twenty-two or twenty-three
years. The average of life is more uniform with
them than with man. These figures are not
mere guesswork, but are deduced from reliable
data.</p>

<p>The period of gestation in both these apes is a
matter that cannot be stated with certainty. Some
of the natives say that it is nine months, while
others believe that it is seven months or less, and
there are some facts to support both of these claims,
but nothing quite conclusive. The sum of the
evidence that I could find rather pointed to a term
of three months or thereabouts as the true period.
During the months of February and March the
male gorillas are vociferous in their screaming, the
young adults separate from the families, and some
other things indicate that this is the season of pairing
and breeding. Such may not be the case, but the
inference is well-founded. It is quite certain that
the season of bearing the young is from the beginning
of May to the end of June. It is about this
time that the dry season begins and continues for
four months. It would appear that nature has
selected this period of the year because it is more
favourable for rearing the young. During this
season food is more abundant and can be secured
with less effort. The lowlands are drier, and this
enables the mother to retire to the dense jungle with
her young, where she is less exposed to danger than
she would be in the more open forest.</p>

<p>It is not certain whether the periods are the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
with both apes or not, and native reports differ
on this point, but it is probable that they are the
same.</p>

<p>From a social point of view, the chimpanzee
appears to be of a little higher caste than other
animals. In his marital ideas he is polygamous,
but is, in a certain degree, loyal to his family. The
paternal instinct is a trifle more refined in him than
in most other animals. He seems to appreciate the
relationship of parent and child more, and retain it
longer than others do. Most male animals discard
their young, and become estranged to them at a very
early age; but the chimpanzee keeps his children
with him until they are old enough to go away and
rear a family of their own.</p>

<p>The family of the chimpanzee frequently consists
of three or four wives and ten or twelve children,
with one adult male; but there are cases known in
which two or three elderly males have been seen in
the same family, but they appear to have their own
wives and children. In such an event, however,
there seems to be one who is supreme. This fact
suggests the idea that among them a form of patriarchal
government prevails. The wives and children
do not appear to question the authority of the
patriarch, or to rebel against it. The male parent
often plays with his children, and appears to be fond
of them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 357px;"><img id="i_055" src="images/i_055.jpg" width="357" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">A STROLL IN THE JUNGLE</div></div>

<p>There is one universal error that I desire here to
correct. It is the common idea that animals are so
strongly possessed of the parental instinct that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
nobly sacrifice their own lives in defence of their
young. I do not wish to dispel any belief that tends
to dignify or ennoble animals, for I am their special
friend and champion; but truth demands that we
qualify this statement. It is quite true that many
have lost their lives in such acts of defence, but it
was not a voluntary sacrifice. It was not alone in
the defence of their young, but in many cases it was
in self-defence. In others, it was from a lack of
judgment. These apes have often been frightened
away from their young, and the latter captured while
the parents were fleeing from the scene. This may
have been the result of sagacity rather than of
depravity, but the parental instinct in both sexes, in
many instances, has failed to restrain them from
flight. If it be a foe that appears to come within
the measure of their own power, they will certainly
defend their young, and this sometimes results in the
loss of their own lives; but if it be one of such
formidable aspect as to appear quite invincible, the
parents leave the young to their fate. This is true
of many other animals, including man.</p>

<p>I have no desire to detract from the heroic quality
of this instinct, or to dim the glory it sheds upon
noble deeds ascribed to it; but the fact that a parent
incurs the risk of its own life in the defence of
its young, is not a true test of its strength or
quality. It is only in the few isolated cases of a
voluntary sacrifice of the parent, foreknowing the
result, that it can be said the act was due to the
instinct. In most cases it is under the belief in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
ability to rescue the one in danger, but the parent is
not wholly aware of its own danger.</p>

<p>I doubt if any animal except man ever deliberately
offered its own life as a ransom for that of another,
and such instances in human history are so rare as
to immortalise the actor.</p>

<p>To whatever extent the instinct may be found, it
is much stronger in the female than in the male, and
it appears to be stronger in domestic animals than
in wild ones. To what extent this is due to their
contact with man, it is difficult to say. The germ
may be inherent, but it certainly yields to culture.</p>

<p>The fact of the ape deserting its offspring under
certain conditions, may be taken as an evidence
of its superior intelligence and its appreciation of
life and danger, rather than a low, brutish impulse.
It is the exercise of superior judgment that causes
man to act with more prudence than other animals.
It does not detract from his nobleness.</p>

<p>Within the family circle of the chimpanzee the
father is supreme; but he does not degrade his
royalty by being a tyrant. Each member of the
family seems to have certain rights that are not
impugned by others. For example, possession is the
right of ownership. When one ape procures a
certain article of food, the others do not try to
dispossess it. It is from this source, doubtless, that
man inherits the idea of private ownership. It is
the same principle amplified by which nations hold
the right of territory, but nations often violate this
right, and so do chimpanzees when not held in check<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
by something more potent than a sense of justice.
With all due respect, I do not think the ape abuses
the right by urging his claim beyond his real needs,
while nations sometimes do.</p>

<p>When a member of a family of apes is ill, the
others are quite conscious of it, and evince a certain
amount of solicitude. Their conduct indicates
that they have, in a small degree, the passion of
sympathy, but the emotion is feeble and wavering.
So far as I know, they do not essay any treatment,
except to soothe and comfort the sufferer. They
surely have some definite idea of what death is, and
I have reason to believe that they have a name for
it. They do not readily abandon their sick, but
when one of them is unable to travel with the band,
the others rove about for some days, within call of
it, but do not minister to its wants.</p>

<p>It is said, if one of them is wounded, the others
will rescue it if possible, and convey it to a place of
safety; but I cannot vouch for this, as such an incident
has never come within my own experience.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of all the social habits
of the chimpanzee, is the <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kanjo</i>, as it is called in the
native tongue. The word does not mean "dance"
in the sense of saltatory gyrations, but implies more
the idea of "carnival." It is believed that more
than one family takes part in these festivities.</p>

<p>Here and there in the jungle is found a small
spot of sonorous earth. It is irregular in shape, but
is about two feet across. The surface is of clay, and
is artificial. It is superimposed upon a kind of peat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
bed, which, being very porous, acts as a resonance
cavity, and intensifies the sound. This constitutes
a kind of drum. It yields rather a dead sound, but
of considerable volume.</p>

<p>This queer drum is made by chimpanzees, who
secure the clay along the bank of some stream in
the vicinity. They carry it by hand, and deposit it
while in a plastic state, spread it over the place
selected, and let it dry. I have, in my possession, a
part of one that I brought home with me from the
Nkami forest. It shows the finger-prints of the
apes, which were impressed in it while the mud was
yet soft.</p>

<p>After the drum is quite dry, the chimpanzees
assemble by night in great numbers, and the carnival
begins. One or two will beat violently on this dry
clay, while others jump up and down in a wild and
grotesque manner. Some of them utter long,
rolling sounds, as if trying to sing. When one tires
of beating the drum, another relieves him, and the
festivities continue in this fashion for hours.</p>

<p>I know of nothing like this in the social economy
of any other animal, but what it signifies, or what
its origin was, is quite beyond my knowledge. It
appears probable that they do not indulge in this
<i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kanjo</i> in all parts of their domain, nor do they occur
at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee is averse to solitude. He is fond
of the society of man, and is easily domesticated.
If allowed to go at liberty, he is well-disposed, and
is strongly attached to man, but if confined, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
becomes vicious and ill-tempered. All animals, including
man, have the same tendency.</p>

<p>Mentally the chimpanzee occupies a high plane
within his own sphere of life, but within those limits
the faculties of the mind are not called into frequent
exercise, and therefore they are not so active as they
are in man.</p>

<p>It is difficult to compare the mental status of the
ape to that of man, because there is no common
basis upon which the two rest. Their modes of life
are so unlike, as to afford no common unit of
measure. Their faculties are developed along
different lines. The two have but few problems in
common to solve. While the scope of the human
mind is vastly wider than that of the ape, it does not
follow that it can act with more precision in all
things. There are, perhaps, instances in which the
mind of the ape excels that of man, by reason of its
adaptation to certain conditions. It is not a safe
and infallible guide to measure all things by the
standard of man's opinion of himself. It is quite
true that, by such a unit of measure, the comparison
is much in favour of the man, but the conclusion is
neither just nor adequate.</p>

<p>It is a problem of great interest, however, to
compare them in this manner, and the result would
indicate that a fair specimen of the ape is in about
the same mental horizon as a child of one year
old. But if the operation were reversed, and man
were placed under the natural conditions of the
ape, the comparison would be much less in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
favour. There is no common mental unit between
them.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee exercises the faculty of reason
with a fair degree of precision, on problems that
concern his own comfort or safety. He is quick to
interpret motives, to discern intents, and is a rare
judge of character. He is inquisitive, but not so
imitative as monkeys are. He is more observant of
the relations of cause and effect, and in his actions
he is controlled by more definite motives. He is
docile, and quickly learns anything that lies within
the range of his own mental plane.</p>

<p>The opinion has long prevailed that these apes
subsist upon a vegetable diet, but such is not in anywise
the case. In this respect their habits are the
same as those of man, except that the latter has
learned to cook his food, while the former eats his raw.</p>

<p>Their natural tastes are much diversified, and
they are not all equally fond of the same articles of
food. Most of them are partial to the wild mango,
which grows in abundance in certain localities in the
forest, and is often available when other kinds of
food are scarce. It thus becomes, as it were, a
staple article of food. There are many kinds of nuts
to be found in their domain, but the oil palm nut
appears to be a favourite. They also eat the kola
nut, when it is to be had. Several kinds of small
fruits and berries also form a part of their diet.
They eat the stalks of some plants, the tender buds
of others, and the tendrils of certain vines, the names
of which I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Most of the fruits and plants that are relished by
them are either acidulous or bitter in taste, and they
are not especially fond of sweet fruits, if they can
get those having the flavours mentioned. They eat
bananas, pine-apples, and other sweet fruits, but not
from choice. Most of them appear to prefer a lime
to an orange, a plantain to a banana, or a kola nut
to a sweet mango, but in captivity they acquire a
taste for sweet foods of all kinds.</p>

<p>In addition to these articles they devour birds,
lizards, and small rodents. They rob the birds of
their eggs and their young. They make havoc on
many kinds of large insects. Those that I have
owned were fond of cooked meats and salt fish, either
raw or cooked.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE SPEECH OF CHIMPANZEES</span></h2>

<p>The speech of chimpanzees is limited to a few
sounds, and these are confined chiefly to their
natural wants. The entire vocabulary of their
language embraces perhaps not more than twenty
words, and many of them are vague or ambiguous,
but they express the concept of the ape with as
much precision as it is defined to his mind, and quite
distinctly enough for his purpose.</p>

<p>In my researches I have learned about ten words
of his speech, so that I can understand them, and
make myself understood by them. Most of these
sounds are within the compass of the human voice,
in tone, pitch, and modulation; but two of them
are much greater in volume than it is possible for
the human lungs to reach, and one of them rises to
a pitch more than an octave higher than any human
voice. These two sounds are audible at a great
distance, but they do not fall within the true limits
of speech.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_065" src="images/i_065.jpg" width="600" height="416" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">THE EDGE OF THE JUNGLE</div></div>

<p>The vocal organs of this ape resemble those
of man as closely as any other character has been
shown to resemble. They differ slightly in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
detail that is worthy of notice. Just above the
opening called the glottis, which is between the
vocal cords, are two small sacs or ventricles. These,
in the ape, are larger and more flexible than in man.
In the act of speaking they are inflated by the air
passing out of the lungs through the long tube
called the larynx. The function of these organs
is to control and modify the sound by increasing
or decreasing the pressure of the air that is jetted
through this tube. They serve, at the same time,
as a reservoir and a gauge.</p>

<p>In the louder sounds produced by the chimpanzee
these ventricles distend until the membrane of which
they are composed is held at a high tension. This
greatly intensifies the voice, and increases its volume.
It is partly due to these little sacs that the ape
is able to make such a loud and piercing scream.
But the pitch and volume of his voice cannot be due
to this cause alone, for the gorilla, in which these
ventricles are much smaller, can make a vastly
louder sound, unless we are mistaken about the one
ascribed to him.</p>

<p>Although the sounds made by the chimpanzee
can be imitated by the human voice, they cannot
be expressed or represented by any system of
phonetic symbols in use among men. All alphabets
have been deduced from pictographs, and the
symbol that represents any given sound has no
reference to the organs that produced it. The few
rigid lines that have survived to form the alphabets
are conventional, and within themselves meaningless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
but they have been so long used to represent
these sounds of speech that it would be difficult
to supplant them with others, even if such were
desired.</p>

<p>As no literal formula can be made to represent
the phonetic elements of the speech of chimpanzees,
I have taken a new step in the art of writing by
framing a system of my own, which is rational in
plan and simple in device.</p>

<p>The organs of speech always act in harmony, and
a certain movement of the lips is always attended
by a certain movement of the internal organs of
speech. This is true of the ape as well as of man,
and in order to utter the same sounds each would
employ the same organs, and use them in the same
way.</p>

<p>By this means, deaf mutes are able to distinguish
the sounds of speech and reproduce them, although
they do not hear them. By close study and long
practice they learn to distinguish the most delicate
shades of sound.</p>

<p>In this plain fact lies the clue to the method I
have used. It is, as yet, only in the infant state, but
it is possible to be made, with a very few symbols,
to represent the whole range of vocal sounds made
by man or other animals.</p>

<p>The chief symbols I employ are the parentheses
used in common print. The two curved lines placed
with the convex sides opposite, thus, (), represent
the open glottis, in which position the voice will
utter the deep sound of "O." The glottis about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
half closed utters the sound of "U," as in the
German, and to represent this sound a period is
inserted between the two curved lines, thus, (.).
When the aperture is contracted still more it produces
the sound of "A" broad, and to represent
this a colon is placed between the lines, thus, (:).
When the aperture is restricted to a still smaller
compass the sound of "U" short is uttered, and to
represent this an apostrophe is placed between the
lines, thus, ('). When the vocal cords are brought
to a greater tension, and the aperture is almost
closed, it utters the short sound of "E." To
represent this sound a hyphen is inserted between
the lines, thus, (-). These are the main vowel sounds
of all animals, although in man they are sometimes
modified, and to them is added the sound of "E"
long, while in the ape the long sounds of "O" and
"E" are rarely, if ever, heard.</p>

<p>From this vowel basis all other sounds may be
deduced, and by the use of diacritics to indicate the
movement of the organs of speech, the consonant
elements may be easily expressed.</p>

<p>A single parenthesis, with the concave side to the
left, will represent the initial sound of "W," which
seldom, but sometimes, occurs in the sounds of
animals. When used, it is placed on the left side of
the leading symbol, thus,)(), and this symbol, as it
stands, should be pronounced nearly like "U-O,"
but with the first letter suppressed, and almost inaudible.
Turning the concave side to the right, and
placing it on the right side of the symbol, it represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the vanishing sound of "W," thus, ()(. This
symbol reads "O-U," with the "O" long, and the
"W" depressed into the short sound of "U." The
apostrophe placed before or after the symbol will
represent "F" or "V." The grave accent, thus, (`),
represents the breathing sound of "H," whether
placed before or after the symbol, and the acute
accent, thus, (´), will represent the aspirate sound of
that letter in the same way.</p>

<p>When the symbol is written with a numeral exponent,
it indicates the degree of loudness. If there is
no figure, the sound is such as would be made by the
human voice in ordinary speech. The letter "X"
will indicate a repetition of the sound, and the
numeral placed after it will show the number of
times repeated, instead of the degree of loudness.
For example, we will write the sound (.), which is
equivalent to long "U," made in a normal tone, the
same symbol written thus (.)2 indicates the sound,
made with greater energy, and about twice as loud.
To write it thus, (.)X2, indicates that the sound was
repeated, and so on.</p>

<p>One peculiar sound made by these animals,
which is described in connection with the gorilla,
appears to be the result of inhalation, but I know
of no other animal that makes a sound in this
manner.</p>

<p>As an example of the use of this method, we will
write the French word "feu," which Moses mastered,
thus, '('), which is equivalent to "vû" with the "U"
sounded short, the other word "wie," in German,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
thus,)('), which is pronounced almost like "wû,"
giving "u" the short sound again.</p>

<p>I shall not lead the reader through the long and
painful task by giving the entire system as far as I
have gone, but what has been given will convey an
idea of a system, by means of which it will be possible
to represent the sounds of all animals, so that
the student of phonetics will recognise at once the
character of the sound, even if he cannot reproduce
it by natural means.</p>

<p>It would be tedious and of no avail to the casual
reader to reduce to writing here the sounds made by
the chimpanzee; but it may be of interest to mention
and describe the character and use of some of them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most frequent sound made by all
animals, appears to be that referring to food, and
therefore it may claim the first place in our attention.
This word in the language of the chimpanzee begins
with the short sound of the vowel "u" which blends
into a strong breathing sound of "h," the lips are
compressed at the sides, and the aperture of the
mouth is nearly round. It is not difficult to imitate,
and the ape readily understands it even when poorly
made.</p>

<p>Another sound of frequent use among them is that
used for calling. The vowel element is nearly the
same, though slightly sharpened, and merges into a
distinct vanishing "w." The food sound is often
repeated two or three times in succession, but the
call is rarely ever repeated, except at long intervals.</p>

<p>One sound is particularly soft and musical, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
vowel element is that of long "u" as in the German.
This blends into a "w," followed by the slightest
suggestion of the short sound of "a." It appears to
express affection or love. This sound is also the
first of the series of sounds attributed to the gorilla.</p>

<p>The most complex sound made by them is the one
elsewhere described as meaning "good." They
often use it in a sense very much the same as mankind
uses the word "thanks," but it is not probable
that they use it as a polite term, yet the same idea is
present.</p>

<p>One of the words of warning or alarm contains a
vowel element closely resembling the short sound of
"e." It terminates with the breathing sound of "h."
It is used to announce the approach of anything that
he is familiar with, and not afraid of. If the sound
is intended to warn against the approach of an enemy,
or something strange, the same vowel element is
used, but terminates with the aspirate sound of "h"
pronounced with energy and distinctness. The two
words are the same in vowel quality, but they differ
in the time required to utter them, and the final
breathing and aspirate effects. There is also a
difference in the manner of the speaker in the act of
delivering the word, which plainly indicates that he
knows the use and value of the sounds. At the
approach of danger the latter is often given almost
in a whisper, and at long intervals apart, but increases
in loudness as the danger approaches; the other is
usually spoken distinctly and repeated frequently.
It is worthy of note that the native tribes often use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the same word in the same manner and for the same
purpose.</p>

<p>There are other sounds which are easily identified
but difficult to describe, such as that used to signify
"cold" or "discomfort"; another for "drink";
another referring to "illness," and still another which
I have good reason to believe means "dead" or
"death." There are perhaps a dozen more that I
can distinguish, but have not yet been able to
determine their meaning. I have an opinion as to
some of them which I have not yet verified.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee makes use of a few signs which
seem to be fixed factors of expression. He makes
a negative sign by moving the head from side to
side, but the gesture is not frequent or pronounced.
Another negative sign, which is more common, is a
motion of the hand from the body towards the person
or thing addressed. This sign is sometimes made
with great emphasis, and there can be no question
as to what it means. The manner of making the
sign is not uniform. Sometimes it is done by an
urgent motion of the hand. Bringing it from his
opposite side, with the back forward, it is waved
towards any one approaching, if the ape object to
the approach. The same sign is often made as a
refusal of anything offered him. Another way of
making this sign is with the arm extended forward,
the hand hanging down, and the back towards
the person approaching or the thing refused. In
addition to these negative signs there is one which
may be regarded as affirmative. It is made simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
by extending one arm towards the person or thing
desired. It sometimes serves the purpose of beckoning;
but in this act there is no motion of the hand.
These signs are similar in character to those used
by men, and appear to be innate.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred from this small list of
words and signs that there is nothing left to learn.
So far we have only taken the first step as it were
in the study of the speech of apes. As we grow
more familiar with their sounds, it becomes less
difficult to understand them. I have not been disappointed
in what I hoped to learn from these
animals. The total number of words in the speech
of all simians that I have learned up to this time is
about one hundred. I have given no attention of
late to the small monkeys, but I shall resume the
task at some future day, as it forms a part of the
work I have assumed, but all of that is described in
a work already published.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I will say that the sounds uttered
by these apes have all the characteristics of true
speech. The speaker is conscious of the meaning
of the sound used, and uses it with the definite purpose
of conveying an idea to the one addressed; the
sound is always addressed to some definite one, and
the speaker usually looks at the one addressed; he
regulates the pitch and volume of the voice to suit
the condition under which it is used; he knows the
value of sound as a medium of thought. These
and many other facts show that they are truly
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
If these apes were placed under domestication,
and kept there as long as the dog has been, he
would be as far superior to the dog in sagacity as
he is by nature above the wild progenitors of the
canine race.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE CAPTURE AND CHARACTER OF MOSES</span></h2>

<p>During my sojourn in the forest, I had a fine,
young chimpanzee, which was of ordinary intelligence,
and of more than ordinary interest, because
of his history.</p>

<p>I gave him the name Moses, not in derision of the
historic Israelite of that name, but because of the
circumstances of his capture and life.</p>

<p>He was found all alone in a wild papyrus swamp
of the Ogowe River. No one knew who his parents
were, or how he ever came to be left in that dismal
place. The low bush in which he was crouched
when discovered was surrounded by water, and the
poor little waif was cut off from the adjacent dry
land.</p>

<p>As the native who captured him approached, the
timid little ape tried to climb up among the vines
above him, and escape, but the agile hunter seized
him before he could do so. At first the chimpanzee
screamed, and struggled to get away, because he
had perhaps never before seen a man, but when he
found that he was not going to be hurt, he put his
frail arms around his captor, and clung to him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
friend. Indeed, he seemed glad to be rescued from
such a dreary place, even by such a strange creature
as a man.</p>

<p>For a moment the man feared that the cries of
his young prisoner might call its mother to the
rescue, and possibly a band of others; but if she
heard them, she did not respond, so he tied the baby
captive with a thong of bark, put him into his canoe,
and brought him away to the village, where he
supplied him with food, and made him quite cosy.
The next day he was sold to a trader. About this
time I passed up the river on my way to the jungle
in search of the gorilla and other apes. Stopping
at the station of the trader, I bought him, and took
him along with me. We soon became the best of
friends and constant companions.</p>

<p>It was supposed that the mother chimpanzee left
her babe in the tree while she went off in search of
food, and wandered so far away that she lost her
bearings and could not again find him. He appeared
to have been for a long time without food,
and may have been crouching there in the forks of
that tree for a day or two; but such was only
inferred from his hunger, as there was no way to
determine how long he had remained, or even how
he got there.</p>

<p>I designed to bring Moses up in the way that
good chimpanzees ought to be brought up, so I
began to teach him good manners in the hope that
some day he would be a shining light to his race,
and aid me in my work among them. To that end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
I took great care of him, and devoted much time to
the study of his natural manners, and to improving
them as much as his nature would allow.</p>

<p>I built him a neat little house within a few feet of
my cage. It was enclosed with a thin cloth, and
had a curtain hung at the door, to keep out mosquitoes
and other insects. It was supplied with
plenty of soft, clean leaves, and some canvas bed-clothing.
It was covered over with a bamboo roof,
and suspended a few feet from the ground, so as to
keep out the ants.</p>

<p>Moses soon learned to adjust the curtain, and go
to bed without my aid. He would lie in bed in the
morning until he heard me or the boy stirring about
the cage, when he would poke his little black head
out, and begin to jabber for his breakfast. Then he
would climb out, and come to the cage to see what
was going on.</p>

<p>He was not confined at all, but quite at liberty to
go about in the forest, climb the trees and bushes,
and have a good time of it. He was jealous of the
boy, and the boy was jealous of him, especially
when it came to a question of eating. Neither of
them seemed to want the other to eat anything that
they mutually liked, and I had to act as umpire in
many of their disputes on that grave subject, which
seemed to be the central thought of both of them.</p>

<p>I frequently allowed Moses to dine with me, and
I never knew him to refuse, or to be late in coming
on such occasions, but his table etiquette was not
of the best order. I gave him a tin plate and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
wooden spoon, but he did not like to use the latter,
and seemed to think that it was pure affectation for
any one to eat with such an awkward thing. He
always held it in one hand, while he ate with the
other, or drank his soup out of the plate.</p>

<p>It was such a task to get washing done in that
part of the world, that I resorted to all means of
economy in that matter, and for a tablecloth I used
a leaf of newspaper, when I had it. To tear that
paper afforded Moses an amount of pleasure that
nothing else would, and in this act his conduct was
more like that of a naughty child than in anything
he did.</p>

<p>When he would first take his place at the table,
he behaved in a nice and becoming manner; but
having eaten till he was quite satisfied, he usually
became rude and saucy. He would slily put his
foot up over the edge of the table, and catch hold of
the corner of the paper, meanwhile watching me
closely, to see if I was going to scold him. If I
remained quiet he would tear it just a little and wait
to see the result. If no notice was taken of that, he
would tear it a little more, but keep watching my
face to see when I observed it. If I raised my
finger to him, he quickly let go, drew his foot down,
and began to eat. If nothing more was done to
stop him, the instant my finger and eyes were
dropped, that dexterous foot was back on the table
and the mischief resumed with more audacity than
before.</p>

<p>When he carried his fun too far, I made him get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
down from the table and sit on the floor. This
humiliation he did not like at best, but when the
boy would grin at him for it, he would resent it
with as much temper as if he had been poked
with a stick. He certainly was sensitive on this
point, and evinced an undoubted dislike to being
laughed at.</p>

<p>Another habit that Moses had was putting his
fingers in the dish to help himself. He had to be
watched all the time to prevent this, and seemed
unable to grasp any reason why he should not be
allowed to do so. He always appeared to think my
spoon, knife and fork were better than his own
spoon. On one occasion he persisted in begging
for my fork until I gave it to him. He dipped it
into his soup, held it up, and looked at it as if disappointed.
He again stuck it into his soup, and then
examined it, as if to see how I lifted my food with
it. He did not seem to notice that I used it in
lifting meat instead of soup. After repeating this
three or four times, he licked the fork, smelt it, and
then deliberately threw it on the floor, as if to say,
"That's a failure." He leaned over and drank his
soup from the plate.</p>

<p>The only thing that he cared much to play with
was a tin can that I kept some nails in. For this
he had a kind of mania, and never tired of trying to
remove the lid. When given the hammer and a
nail, he knew what they were for, and would set to
work to drive the nail into the floor of the cage or
the table; but he hurt his fingers a few times, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
after that he stood the nail on its flat head, removed
his fingers and struck it with the hammer, but, of
course, never succeeded in driving it into anything.</p>

<p>A bunch of sugar-cane was kept for Moses to eat
when he wanted it, and to aid him in tearing the
hard shell away from it, I kept a club to bruise it.
Sometimes he would go and select a stalk of the
cane, carry it to the block, take the club in both
hands, and try to mash the cane himself; but as the
jar of the stroke often hurt his hands, he learned to
avoid this, by letting go as the club descended. He
never succeeded in crushing the cane, but would
continue his efforts until some one came to his aid.
At other times he would drag a stalk of the cane
to the cage, poke it through the wires, then bring
the club, and poke it through, to get me to mash it
for him.</p>

<p>From time to time I received newspapers sent
me from home. Moses could not understand what
induced me to sit holding that thing before me, but
he wished to try it, and see. He would take a leaf
of it, and hold it up before him with both hands,
just as he saw me do; but instead of looking at the
paper, he kept his eyes, most of the time, on me.
When I would turn mine over, he did the same
thing, but half the time had it upside down. He
did not appear to care for the pictures, or notice
them, except a few times he tried to pick them off
the paper; and one large cut of a dog's head, when
held at a short distance from him, he appeared to
regard with a little interest, as if he recognised it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
as that of an animal of some kind, but I cannot
say just what his ideas concerning it really were.</p>

<p>Chimpanzees are not usually so playful or funny
as monkeys, but they have a certain degree of mirth
in their nature, and at times display a marked sense
of humour.</p>

<p>One thing that Moses liked was to play peek-a-boo
with me or the boy. He did not try to conceal
his body from view, but would hide his eyes, and
then peep. A favourite time for this was in the early
part of the afternoon. He would often go and put
his head behind a large tin box in the cage, while
his whole body was visible. In this attitude he
would utter a series of peculiar sounds, then draw
his head out, and look at me, to see if I was watching
him. If not, he would repeat the act a few
times, and then hunt something else to amuse himself
with. But if he could gain attention, the romp
began, and he found great pleasure in this simple
pastime. He would roll over, kick up his heels,
and grin, with evident delight.</p>

<p>I spent much time in entertaining him in this
way, and felt amply repaid for it in the gratification
it afforded him. I could not resist his overtures to
play, as he was my companion and my friend, and,
living in that solitary gloom, it was a mutual
pleasure.</p>

<p>Another occasion on which he used to peep at
me was when he lay down to take his midday nap.
For this I had made him a little hammock, which
was suspended by wires, so that it could be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
when not in use. I always hung this by my
side in the cage, so I could swing him to sleep like
a child. He liked this, and I liked to indulge him.
When he was laid in it, he was usually covered up
with a small piece of canvas, and in spreading it
over him, I frequently laid the edge of it over his
eyes, but he seemed to suspect me of having some
motive in doing so. Often he would reach his
fingers up, catch the edge of the cloth, and gently
draw it down, so he could see what I was doing.
If he saw that he was detected, he would quickly
release it, and cuddle down, as if it had been done
by accident; but the little rogue knew, just as well
as I did, what it meant to peep.</p>

<p>I also made him another hammock, and hung it
out a few yards from the cage, so he could get into
it without bothering me; but he never cared for it,
until I brought a young gorilla to live with us in
our jungle home, and as Moses never used it, I
assigned it to the new member of the household.
Whenever the gorilla got into it there was a small
row about it. Moses would never allow him to
occupy it in peace. He seemed to know that it was
his own by right, and the gorilla was regarded as an
intruder. He would push and shove the gorilla,
grunt and whine and quarrel, until he got him out
of it; but after doing so he would leave it, and
climb up into a bush, or go away to hunt something
to eat. He only wanted to dispossess the intruder,
for whom he nursed an inordinate jealousy. He
never went near the gorilla's little house, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
on the opposite side of the cage from his own; even
after the gorilla died, he kept aloof from it.</p>

<p>As a rule, I always took Moses with me in my
rambles into the forest, and I found him to be quite
useful in one way. His eyes were like the lens of
a camera&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;nothing escaped them; and when he
discovered anything in the jungle, he always made
it known by a peculiar sound. He could not point
it out with his finger, but by watching his eyes the
object could often be located.</p>

<p>Frequently during these tours the ape rode on
my shoulders, and at other times the boy carried
him, but occasionally he was put down on the
ground to walk. If we travelled at a very slow
pace, and allowed him to stroll along at leisure, he
was content to do so, but if hurried beyond a certain
gait he always made a display of his temper. He
would turn on the boy and attack him, if possible;
but if the boy escaped, the angry little ape would
throw himself down on the ground, scream, kick,
and beat the earth with his own head and hands in
the most violent and persistent manner. He sometimes
did the same way when not allowed to have
what he wanted. His conduct was exactly like that
of a spoiled, ugly child.</p>

<p>He had a certain amount of ingenuity, and often
evinced a degree of reason which was rather unexpected.
It was not a rare thing for him to solve
some problem that involved a study of cause and
effect, but always in a limited degree. I would not
be understood to mean that he could work out any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
abstract problem, such as belongs to the realm of
mathematics, but simple, concrete problems, where
the object was present.</p>

<p>On one occasion, while walking through the forest
we came to a small stream of water. The boy and
myself stepped across it, leaving Moses to get over it
without help. He disliked getting his feet wet, and
paused to be lifted across. We walked a few steps
away, and waited. He looked up and down the
branch to see if there was any way to avoid it. He
walked back and forth a few yards, but found no
way to cross it. He sat down on the bank, and
declined to wade it. After a few moments he
waddled along the bank, about ten or twelve feet,
to a clump of tall slender bushes growing by the
edge of the stream. Here he halted, whined, and
looked up into them thoughtfully. At length he
began to climb one of them that leaned over the
water. As he climbed up, the stalk bent with his
weight, and in an instant he was swung safely
across the little brook. He let go the plant, and
came hobbling along to me with a look of triumph
on his face that plainly indicated that he was fully
conscious of having performed a very clever feat.</p>

<p>One dark, rainy night I felt something pulling at
my blanket and mosquito bar. I could not for a
moment imagine what it was, but knew that it was
something on the outside of my cage. I lay for
a few seconds, and felt another strong pull at
them. In an instant some cold, damp, rough thing
touched my face, and I found it was his hand poked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
through the meshes and groping about for something.
I spoke to him, and he replied with a series
of plaintive sounds which assured me that something
must be wrong.</p>

<p>I arose, and lighted a candle. His little brown
face was pressed up against the wires, and wore a
sad, weary look. He could not tell me in words
what troubled him, but every sign, look, and gesture
bespoke trouble. Taking the candle in one hand,
and my revolver in the other, I stepped out of the
cage and went to his domicile, where I discovered
that a colony of ants had invaded his quarters.</p>

<p>These ants are a great pest when they attack
anything, and when they make a raid on a house
the only thing to be done is to leave it until they
have devoured everything about it that they can eat.
When they leave a house there is not a roach, rat,
bug, or insect left in it.</p>

<p>As the house of Moses was so small, it was not
difficult to dispossess them by saturating it with
kerosene, which was quickly done, and the little
occupant allowed to return and go to bed. He
watched the procedure with evident interest, and
seemed perfectly aware that I could rid him of his
savage assailants. In a wild state he would doubtless
have abandoned his claim, and fled to some
other place without an attempt to drive them away,
but in this instance he had acquired the idea of the
rights of possession.</p>

<p>Moses was especially fond of corned beef and
sardines, and would recognise a can of either as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
away as he could see it. He also knew the instrument
used in opening them, but he did not appear
to appreciate the fact that when the contents had
once been taken out it was useless to open the can
again, so he often brought the empty cans that had
been thrown into the bush, would get the can-opener
down, and want me to use it for him. I never saw
him try to open it himself, except with his fingers.
Sometimes, when about to prepare my own meals, I
would open the case in which I kept stored a supply
of canned meats, and allow Moses to select one for
the purpose. He never failed to pull out one of the
cans of beef, bearing the red and blue label. If I
put it back he would select the same kind, and
could not be deceived in his choice. It was not
accidental, because he would hunt for one until he
found it.</p>

<p>I don't know what he thought when it was not
served for dinner, as I often exchanged it for another
kind without consulting him.</p>

<p>I kept my supply of water in a large jug, which
was placed in the shade of the bushes near the cage.
I also kept a small pan for Moses to drink out of.
He would sometimes ask for water, by using his own
word for it. He would place his pan by the side of
the jug and repeat the sound a few times. If he was
not attended to he proceeded to help himself. He
could take the cork out of the jug quite as well as I
could. He would then put his eye to the mouth of
it, and look down into the vessel to see if there was
any water. Of course the shadow of his head would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
darken the interior of the jug so that he could not
see anything. Then removing his eye from the
mouth of it, he would poke his hand in it, but I
reproved him for this until I broke him of the habit.
After a careful examination of the jug he would try
to pour the water out. He knew how it ought to be
done, but was not able to handle the vessel himself.
He always placed the pan on the lower side of the
jug; then leaned the jug towards it and let go. He
would rarely ever get the water into the pan, but
always turned the jug with the neck down grade.
As a hydraulic engineer he was not a great success,
but he certainly knew the first principles of the
science.</p>

<p>I tried to teach Moses to be cleanly, but it was a
hard task. He would listen to my precepts as if they
had made a deep impression, but he would not wash
his hands of his own accord. He would permit me
or the boy to wash them, but when it came to taking
a bath, or even wetting his face, he was a rank heretic
on the subject, and no amount of logic would convince
him that he needed it. When he was given a bath,
he would scream and fight during the whole process;
and when it was finished he would climb up on the
roof of the cage and spread himself out in the sun.
This was the only occasion on which I ever knew
him to get up on the roof. I don't know why he
disliked it so much. He did not mind getting wet
in the rain, but rather seemed to like that.</p>

<p>He had a great dislike for ants and certain large
bugs. Whenever one came near him he would talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
like a magpie, and brush at it with his hands until
he got rid of it. He always used a certain sound for
this kind of annoyance; it differed slightly from those
I have described as warning.</p>

<p>Moses tried to be honest, but he was affected with
a species of kleptomania, and could not resist the
temptation to purloin anything that came in his way.
The small stove upon which I prepared my food
was placed on a shelf in one corner of the cage, about
half-way between the floor and the top. Whenever
anything was set on the stove to cook, he had to be
watched to keep him from climbing up the side of
the cage, reaching his arm through the meshes and
stealing it. He was sometimes very persevering in
this matter. One day I set a tin can of water on
the stove to heat in order to make some coffee; he
silently climbed up, reached his hand through, stuck
it in the can, and began to search for anything it
might contain. I threw out the water, refilled the
can, and drove him away. In a few minutes he returned
and repeated the act. I had a piece of canvas
hung up on the outside of the cage to keep him
away. The can of water was placed on the stove
for the third time, but within a minute he found his
way by climbing up under the curtain between it
and the cage. I determined to teach him a lesson.
He was allowed to explore the can, but finding
nothing he withdrew his hand, and sat there clinging
to the side of the cage. Again he tried, but found
nothing. The water was getting warmer, but was
still not hot. At length, for the third or fourth time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
he stuck his hand into it up to the wrist. By this
time the water was so hot that it scalded his hand.
It was not severe enough to do him any harm, but
quite enough so for a good lesson. He jerked his
hand out with such violence that he threw the cup
over, and spilt the water all over that side of the cage.
From that time to the end of his life he always refused
anything that had steam or smoke about it.
If anything having steam or smoke was offered him
at the table, he would climb down at once and retire
from the scene. Poor little Moses! I knew beforehand
what would happen, and I did not wish to see
him hurt, but nothing else would serve to impress
him with the danger and keep him out of mischief.</p>

<p>Anything that he saw me eat he never failed to
beg. No matter what he had himself, he wanted to
try everything else that he saw me eat. One thing
in which these apes appear to be wiser than man is,
that when they eat or drink enough to satisfy their
wants they quit, while men sometimes do not. They
never drink water or anything else during their meal,
but, having finished it, as a rule they always want
something to drink. The native custom is the same.
I have never known the native African to use any
kind of diet drink, but always when he has finished
eating takes a draught of water.</p>

<p>Moses knew the use of nearly all the tools that
I carried with me in the jungle. He could not use
them for the purpose they were intended, and I do
not know to what extent he appreciated their use,
but he knew quite well the manner of using them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
I have mentioned the incident of his using the
hammer and nails, but he also knew the way to use
the saw; however, he always applied the back of it,
because the teeth were too rough, but he gave it the
motion. When allowed to have it, he would put the
back of it across a stick and saw with the energy of
a man on a big salary. When given a file, he would
file everything that came in his way; and if he had
applied himself in learning to talk human speech as
closely and with as much zeal as he tried to use my
pliers, he would have succeeded in a very short
time.</p>

<p>Whether these creatures are actuated by reason
or by instinct in such acts as I have mentioned, the
cavillist may settle for himself; but it accomplishes
the purpose of the actor in a logical and practical
manner, and they are perfectly conscious that it
does.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE LIFE AND DEATH OF MOSES</span></h2>

<p>I know of nothing in the way of affection and loyalty
among animals that can exceed that of my devoted
Moses. Not only was he tame and tractable, but he
never tired of caressing me, and being caressed by
me. For hours together he would cling to my neck,
play with my ears, lips and nose, bite my cheek, and
hug me like a last hope. He was never willing for me
to put him down from my lap, never willing for me to
leave my cage without him, never willing for me to
caress anything else but himself, and never willing for
me to discontinue that. He would cry and fret for
me whenever we were separated, and I must confess
that my absence from him during a journey of three
weeks, hastened his sad and untimely death.</p>

<p>From the second day after we became associated,
he appeared to regard me as the one in authority.
He would not resent anything I did to him. I could
take his food out of his hands, which he would
permit no one else to do. He would follow me, and
cry after me like a child; and as time went by his
attachment grew stronger and stronger. He gave
every evidence of pleasure at my attentions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
evinced a certain degree of appreciation and gratitude
in return. He would divide any morsel of food
with me, which is, perhaps, the highest test of the
affection of any animal. I cannot say that such an
act was genuine benevolence, or an earnest of affection
in a true sense of the term, but nothing except
deep affection or abject fear impels such actions, and
certainly fear was not his motive.</p>

<p>There were others whom he liked and made himself
familiar with; there were some he feared and
others he hated; but his manner towards me was
that of deep affection. It was not alone in return for
the food he received, because my boy gave him food
more frequently than I did, and many others from
time to time fed him. His attachment was like an
infatuation that had no apparent motive, was unselfish
and supreme.</p>

<p>The chief purpose of my living among the animals
being to study the sounds they uttered, I gave strict
attention to those made by Moses. For a time it
was difficult to detect more than two or three distinct
sounds, but as I grew more and more familiar with
them I could detect a variety of them, and by
constantly watching his actions and associating them
with his sounds I learned to interpret certain ones to
mean certain things.</p>

<p>In the course of my sojourn with him I learned a
certain sound that he always uttered when he saw
anything that he was familiar with, such as a man or
a dog, but he could not tell me which of the two it
was. If he saw anything strange to him he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
tell me, but not so that I knew whether it was
a snake or a leopard or a monkey, yet I knew
that it was something of that kind. I learned a
certain word for food, hunger, eating, &amp;c., but he
could not go into any details about it, except that a
certain sound indicated good or satisfaction, and
another meant the opposite.</p>

<p>Among the sounds that I learned was one that is
used by a chimpanzee in calling another to come to
it. Some of the natives assured me that the mothers
always used it in calling their young to them. When
Moses wandered away from the cage into the jungle,
he would sometimes call me with this sound. I
cannot express it in letters of the alphabet, nor
describe it so as to give a very clear idea of its
character. It was a single sound or word of one
syllable, and easily imitated by the human voice. At
any time that I wanted Moses to come to me I used
this word, and the fact that he always obeyed it by
coming confirmed my opinion as to its meaning. I
do not think when he addressed it to me that he
expected me to come to him, but he perhaps wanted
to locate me in order to be guided back to the cage
by the sound. As he grew more familiar with the
surrounding forest he used it less frequently, but he
always employed it in calling me or the boy. When
he was called by it he answered with the same
sound; but one fact that we noticed was that if he
could see the one who called he never made any
reply by sound. He would obey it, but not answer
it; he probably thought if he could see the one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
called that he could be seen by him, and it was therefore
useless to reply.</p>

<p>The speech of these animals is very limited, but it
is sufficient for their purpose. It is none the less
real because of its being restricted, but it is more
difficult for man to learn, because his modes of
thought are so much more ample and distinct. Yet
when one is reduced to the necessity of making his
wants known in a strange tongue, he can express
many things in a very few words. I have once been
thrown among a tribe of whose language I knew less
than fifty words, but with little difficulty I succeeded
in conversing with them on two or three topics.
Much depends upon necessity, and more upon
practice. In talking to Moses I mostly used his own
language, and was surprised at times to see how
readily we understood each other. I could repeat
about all the sounds he made except one or two, but
I was not able in the time we were together to
interpret all of them. These sounds were more than
a mere series of grunts or whines, and he never
confused them in their meaning. When any one of
them was properly delivered to him, he clearly understood
and acted upon it.</p>

<p>It was never any part of my purpose to teach a
monkey to talk, but after I became familiar with the
qualities and range of the voice of Moses, I determined
to see if he might not be taught to speak a
few simple words of human speech. To effect this
in the easiest way and shortest time, I carefully
observed the movements of his lips and vocal organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
in order to select such words for him to try as were
best adapted to his ability.</p>

<p>I selected the word <i>mamma</i>, which may almost be
considered a universal word of human speech; the
French word <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feu</i>, fire; the German word <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">wie</i>, howl,
and the native Nkami word <i xml:lang="nkq" lang="nkq">nkgwe</i>, mother. Every
day I took him on my lap and tried to induce him
to say one or more of these words. For a long
time he made no effort to learn them, but after some
weeks of persistent labour and a bribe of corned
beef, he began to see dimly what I wanted him to
do. The native word quoted is very similar to one
of the sounds of his own speech, which means
"good" or "satisfaction." The vowel element
differs in them, and he was not able in the time he
was under tuition to change them, but he distinguished
them from other words.</p>

<p>In his attempt to say <i>mamma</i> he only worked his
lips without making any sound, although he really
tried to do so, and I believe that in the course of
time he would have succeeded. He observed the
movement of my lips, and tried to imitate them, but
seemed to think that the lips alone produced the sound.</p>

<p>With <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feu</i> he succeeded fairly well, except that the
consonant element as he uttered it resembled "v"
more than "f," so that the sound was more like <i>vu</i>
making the u short as in "nut." It was quite as perfect
as most people of other tongues ever learn to
speak the same word in French, and if it had been
uttered in a sentence, any one knowing that language
would recognise it as meaning fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
In his efforts to pronounce <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">wie</i> he always gave
the vowel element like German "u" with the
<i>umlaut</i>, but the "w" element was more like the
English than the German sound of that letter.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the fact that he was
only a little more than a year old, and was in training
less than three months, his progress was all that
could have been desired, and vastly more than had
been hoped for. Had he lived until this time, it is
my belief that he would have mastered these and
other words of human speech to the satisfaction of
the most exacting linguist. If he had only learned
one word in a whole lifetime, he would have shown
at least that the race is capable of being improved
and elevated in some degree.</p>

<p>Another experiment that I tried with him was one
that I had used before in testing the ability of a
monkey to distinguish forms. I cut a round hole in
one end of a board and a square hole in the other,
and made a block to fit into each one of them. The
blocks were then given to him to see if he could fit
them into the proper holes. After being shown a
few times how to do this, he fitted them in without
difficulty; but when he was not rewarded for the
task by receiving a morsel of corned beef or a
sardine, he did not care to work for the fun alone.</p>

<p>In colours he had but little choice, unless it was
something to eat, but he could distinguish them with
ease if the shades were pronounced.</p>

<p>I had no means of testing his taste for music or
sense of musical sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
I must here take occasion to mention one incident
in the life of Moses that never perhaps occurred
before in the life of any other chimpanzee, and
while it may not be of scientific value, it is at least
amusing.</p>

<p>While living in the jungle, I received a letter
enclosing a contract to be signed by myself and a
witness. Having no means of finding a witness to
sign the paper, I called Moses from the bushes,
placed him at the table, gave him a pen and had
him sign the document as witness. He did not
write his name himself, as he had not yet mastered
the art of writing, but he made his cross mark
between the names, as many a good man had done
before him. I wrote in the blank the name,</p>

<p class="center">
<i>His</i><br />
"<span class="smcap">Moses X Ntyigo</span>"<br />
<i>mark</i>;<br />
</p>

<p class="in0">the cross mark omitted, and had him with his
own hand make the cross as it is legally done by
all people who cannot write. With this signature
the contract was returned in good faith to stand the
test of the law courts of civilisation, and thus for the
first time in the history of the race a chimpanzee
signed his name.</p>

<p>When I prepared to start on a journey across the
Esyira country it was not practicable for me to take
Moses along, so I arranged to leave him in charge
of a missionary. Shortly after my departure the
man was taken with fever, and the chimpanzee was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
left to the care of a native boy belonging to the
mission. The little prisoner was kept confined by a
small rope attached to his cage in order to keep him
out of mischief. It was during the dry season, when
the dews are heavy and the nights chilly, as the
winds at that season are fresh and frequent.</p>

<p>Within a week after leaving him he contracted a
severe cold, which soon developed into acute pulmonary
troubles of a complex type, and he began
to decline. After an absence of three weeks and
three days, I returned to find him in a condition
beyond the reach of treatment. He was emaciated
to a living skeleton: his eyes were sunken deep into
their orbits, and his steps were feeble and tottering;
his voice was hoarse and piping; his appetite was
gone, and he was utterly indifferent to anything
around him.</p>

<p>During my journey I had secured a companion
for him, and when I disembarked from the canoe, I
hastened to him with this new addition to our little
family. I had not been told that he was ill, and was
not prepared to see him looking so ghastly.</p>

<p>When he discovered me approaching, he rose up
and began to call me as he had been wont to do
before I left him, but his weak voice was like a death-knell
to my ears. My heart sunk within me as I
saw him trying to reach out his long, bony arms to
welcome my return. Poor, faithful Moses! I could
not repress the tears of pity and regret at this sudden
change, for to me it was the work of a moment. I
had last seen him in the vigour of a strong and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
robust youth, but now I beheld him in the decrepitude
of a feeble senility. What a transformation!</p>

<p>I diagnosed his case as well as I was able and
began to treat him, but it was evident that he was too
far gone to expect him to recover. My conscience
smote me for having left him, yet I felt that I had
not done wrong. It was not neglect or cruelty for
me to leave him while I went in pursuit of the chief
object of my search, and I had no cause to reproach
myself for having done so. But emotions that are
stirred by such incidents are not to be controlled by
reason or hushed by argument, and the pain that it
caused me was more than I can tell.</p>

<p>If I had done wrong, the only restitution possible
for me to make was to nurse him patiently and
tenderly to the end, or till health and strength should
return. This was conscientiously done, and I have
the comfort of knowing that the last sad days of his
life were soothed by every care that kindness could
suggest. Hour after hour during that time he lay
silent and content upon my lap. That appeared to
be a panacea to all his pains. He would roll his
dark brown eyes up and look into my face, as if to
be assured that I had been restored to him. With
his long fingers he stroked my face as if to say that
he was again happy. He took the medicines I gave
him as if he knew their purpose and effect.</p>

<p>His suffering was not intense, but he bore it like
a philosopher. He seemed to have some vague
idea of his own condition, but I do not know that
he foresaw the result. He lingered on from day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
day for a whole week, slowly sinking and growing
feebler, but his love for me was manifest to the last,
and I dare confess that I returned it with all my
heart.</p>

<p>Is it wrong that I should requite such devotion
and fidelity with reciprocal emotion? No. I should
not deserve the love of any creature if I were indifferent
to the love of Moses. That affectionate
little creature had lived with me in the dismal
shadows of that primeval forest for so many long
days and dreary nights; had romped and played
with me when far away from the pleasures of home,
and had been a constant friend alike through sunshine
and storm. To say that I did not love him
would be to confess myself an ingrate unworthy of
my race.</p>

<p>The last spark of life passed away in the night.
It was not attended by acute pain or struggling,
but, falling into a deep and quiet sleep, he woke no
more.</p>

<p>Moses will live in history. He deserves to do so,
because he was the first of his race that ever spoke
a word of human speech; because he was the first
that ever conversed in his own language with a
human being; and because he was the first that
ever signed his name to any document; and Fame
will not deny him a niche in her temple among the
heroes who have led the races of the world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />

<span class="subhead">AARON</span></h2>

<p>Having arranged my affairs in Fernan Vaz so as to
make a journey across the great forest that lies to
the south of the Nkami country and separates it
from that of the Esyira tribe, I set out by canoe to
a point on the Rembo about three days from the
place where I had so long lived in my cage. At a
village called Tyimba I disembarked, and after a
journey of five days and a delay of three more days
caused by an attack of fever, I arrived at a trading
station near the head of a small river called Ndogo.
It empties into the sea at Sette Kama, about four
degrees south of the equator. The trading post is
about a hundred miles inland, at a native village
called Ntyi-ne-nye-ni, which, strange to say, means
in the native tongue, "Some other place."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_103" src="images/i_103.jpg" width="600" height="393" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">TRADING STATION IN THE INTERIOR</div></div>

<p>About the time I reached here, two Esyira
hunters came from a distant village, and brought
with them a smart young chimpanzee of the kind
known in that country as the <i xml:lang="nkq" lang="nkq">kulu-kamba</i>. He was
quite the finest specimen of his race that I have ever
seen. His frank, open countenance, big brown
eyes and shapely physique, free from mark or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
blemish of any kind, would attract the notice of any
one who was not absolutely stupid.</p>

<p>It is not derogatory to the memory of Moses that
I should say this, nor does it lessen my affection for
him. Our passions are not moved by visible forces
nor measured by fixed units: they disdain all laws
of logic, and spurn the narrow bounds of reason;
they obey no code of ethics that can be defined, and
conform to no theory of action.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw this little ape I expressed a
desire to own him, so the trader in charge bought
him and presented him to me. As it was intended
that he should be the friend and ally of Moses,
although not his brother, we conferred upon him the
name of Aaron, as the two names are so intimately
associated in history that the mention of one always
suggests the other.</p>

<p>Aaron was captured in the Esyira jungle by these
same hunters, about one day's journey from the
place where I secured him; and in this event began
a series of sad scenes in the brief but varied life of
this little hero that seldom come within the experience
of any creature.</p>

<p>At the time of his capture his mother was killed
in the act of defending him from the cruel hunters,
and when she fell to the earth, mortally wounded,
this brave little fellow stood by her trembling body,
defending it against her slayers, until he was overcome
by superior force, seized by his captors, bound
with strips of bark, and carried away into captivity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
No human can refrain from admiring his conduct
in this act, whether it was prompted by the instinct
of self-preservation or by a sentiment of loyalty to
his mother, for he was exercising that prime law of
nature which actuates all creatures to defend themselves
against attack, and his wild, young heart
throbbed with like sensations to those of a human
under a like ordeal.</p>

<p>I do not wish to appear sentimental by offering
a rebuke to those who indulge in the sport of hunting,
but much cruelty could be obviated without
losing any of the pleasure of the hunt, and I have
always made it a rule to spare the mother with her
young. Whether animals feel the same degree of
mental and physical pain as man or not, they do,
in these tragic moments, evince a certain amount of
concern for one another, which imparts a tinge of
sympathy that must appeal to any one who is not
devoid of every sense of mercy.</p>

<p>It is true that it is often difficult, and sometimes
impossible, to secure the young by other means;
but the manner of getting them often mars the
pleasure of having them, and while Aaron was, to
me, a charming pet and a valuable subject for study,
I confess the story of his capture always touched
me in a tender spot.</p>

<p>I may here mention that the few chimpanzees
that reach the civilised parts of the world are but
a small percentage of the great number that are
captured. Some die on their way to the coast,
others die after reaching it, and scores of them die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
on board the ships to which they are consigned for
various ports of Europe and other countries. It is
not often from neglect or cruelty, but usually from a
change of food, climate, or condition, yet the
creature suffers just the same whether the cause
is from design or accident. One fruitful source of
death among them is pulmonary trouble of various
types.</p>

<p>One look at the portrait of Aaron will impress
any one with the high mental qualities of this little
captive, but to see and study him in life would
convince a heretic of his superior character. In
every look and gesture there was a touch of the
human that no one could fail to observe. The
range of facial expression surpassed that of any
other animal I have ever studied. In repose, his
quaint face wore a look of wisdom becoming to a
sage; while in play it was crowned with a grin of
genuine mirth. The deep, searching look he gave
to a stranger was a study for the psychologist, while
the serious, earnest look of inquiry when he was
perplexed would amuse a stoic. All these changing
moods were depicted in his mobile face, with
such intensity as to leave no room to doubt the
activity of certain faculties of the mind in a degree
far beyond that of animals in general; and his conduct,
in many instances, showed the exercise of
mental powers of a higher order than that limited
agency known as instinct.</p>

<p>In addition to these facts, his voice was of better
quality and more flexible than that of any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
specimen I have ever known. It was clear and
smooth in uttering sounds of any pitch within its
scope, while the voices of most of them are inclined
to be harsh or husky, especially in sounds of high
pitch.</p>

<p>Before leaving the village where I secured him, I
made a kind of sling for him to be carried in. It
consisted of a short canvas sack with two holes cut
in the bottom for his legs to pass through. To the
top of this was attached a broad band of the same
cloth by which to hang it over the head of the
carrier boy to whom the little prisoner was consigned.
This afforded the ape a comfortable seat,
and at the same time reduced the labour of carrying
him. It left his arms and legs free, so he could
change his position and rest, while it also allowed
the boy the use of his own hands in passing any
difficult place in the jungle along the way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_109" src="images/i_109.jpg" width="600" height="423" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PLAIN AND EDGE OF THE FOREST</div></div>

<p>From there to the Rembo was a journey of five
days on foot. Along the way were a few straggling
villages, but most of the route lay through a wild
and desolate forest, traversed by low broad marshes,
through which wind shallow sloughs of filthy greenish
water, seeking its way among bending roots and
fallen leaves. From the foul bosom of these
marshes rise the effluvia of decaying plants, breeding
pestilence and death. Here and there across
the dreary tracts is found the trail of elephants,
where the great beasts have broken their tortuous
way through the dense barriers of bush and vine.
These trails serve as roads for the native traveller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
and afford the only way of crossing these otherwise
trackless jungles.</p>

<p>The only means of passing these dismal swamps
is to wade through the thin slimy mud, often more
than knee-deep, and sometimes extending many
hundred feet in width, intercepted at almost every
step by the tangled roots of mangrove-trees under
foot, or clusters of vines hanging from the boughs
overhead.</p>

<p>Such was the route we came, but Aaron did not
realise how severe the task of his carrier was in
trudging his way through such places, and the little
rogue often added to the labour by seizing hold of
limbs or vines that hung within his reach in passing,
and thus retarded the progress of the boy, who
strongly protested against the ape amusing himself
in this manner. The latter seemed to know of no
reason why he should not do so, and the former did
not deign to give one, and so the quarrel went on
until we reached the river, but by that time each of
them had imbibed a hatred for the other that
nothing in the future ever allayed. Neither of
them ever forgot it while they were associated, and
both of them evinced their aversion on all occasions.
The boy gave vent to his dislike by making ugly
faces at the ape, which the latter resented by
screaming and trying to bite him. Aaron refused
to eat any food given him by the boy, and the boy
would not give him a morsel except when required
to do so. At times the feud became ridiculous, and
it only ended in their final separation. The last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
time I ever saw the boy I asked him if he wanted
to go with me to my country to take care of
Aaron, but he shook his head, and said, "He's a
bad man."</p>

<p>This was the only person for whom I ever knew
Aaron to conceive a deep and bitter dislike, but the
boy he hated with his whole heart.</p>

<p>On my return to Fernan Vaz, where I had left
Moses, I found him in a feeble state of health as
related elsewhere. When Aaron was set down
before him, he merely gave the little stranger a
casual glance, but held out his long lean arms for
me to take him in mine. His wish was gratified,
and I indulged him in a long stroll. When we
returned I set him down by the side of his new
friend, who evinced every sign of pleasure and
interest. He was like a small boy when there is a
new baby in the house. He cuddled up close to
Moses and made many overtures to become friends,
but while the latter did not repel them he treated
them with indifference. Aaron tried in many ways
to attract his attention, or to elicit some sign of
approval, but it was in vain.</p>

<p>No doubt the manners of Moses were due to his
health, and Aaron seemed to realise it. He sat for
a long time, holding a banana in his hand, and looking
with evident concern into the face of his little
sick cousin. At length he lifted the fruit to the lips
of the invalid and uttered a low sound, but the
kindness was not accepted. The act was purely
one of his own volition, in which he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
prompted by any suggestion from others, and every
look and motion indicated a desire to relieve or
comfort his friend. His manner was gentle and
humane, and his face was an image of pity.</p>

<p>Failing to get any sign of attention from Moses,
he moved up closer to his side and put his arms
around him in the same manner that he is seen in
the picture with Elisheba.</p>

<p>During the days that followed, he sat hour after
hour in this same attitude, and refused to allow any
one except myself to touch his patient; but on my
approach he always resigned him to me, while he
watched with interest to see what I did for him.</p>

<p>Among other things, I gave him a tabloid of
quinine and iron twice a day. These were dissolved
in a little water and given to him in a small tin cup
which was kept for the purpose. When not in use,
it was hung upon a tall post. Aaron soon learned
to know the use of it, and whenever I would go to
Moses, he would climb up the post and bring me
the cup to administer the medicine.</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred that he knew anything
about the nature or effect of the medicine, but he
knew the use, and the only use, to which that cup
was put.</p>

<p>During the act of administering the medicine,
Aaron displayed a marked interest in the matter, and
seemed to realise that it was intended for the good
of the patient. He would sit close up to one side of
the sick one and watch every movement of his face,
as if to see what effect was being produced, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the changing expressions of his own visage plainly
showed that he was not passive to the actions of
the patient.</p>

<p>While I was present with the sick one, Aaron
appeared to feel a certain sense of relief from the
care of him, and frequently went climbing about as
if to rest and recreate himself by a change of routine.
While I would take Moses for a walk, or sit with
him on my lap, his little nurse was perfectly content;
but the instant they were left alone, Aaron would
again fold him in his arms as if he felt it a duty to
do so.</p>

<p>It was only natural that Moses, in such a state of
health, should be cross and peevish at times, as
people in a like condition are; but during the time I
never once saw Aaron resent anything he did, or
display the least ill-temper towards him, but, on the
contrary, his conduct was so patient and forbearing
that it was hard to forego the belief that it was
prompted by the same motives of kindness and
sympathy that move the human heart to deeds of
tenderness and mercy.</p>

<p>At night, when they were put to rest, they lay
cuddled up in each other's arms, and in the morning
they were always found in the same close embrace;
but on the morning Moses died, the conduct of
Aaron was unlike anything I had observed before.
When I approached their snug little house and drew
aside the curtain, I found him sitting in one corner
of the cage. His face wore a look of concern as if
he was aware that something awful had occurred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
When I opened the door, he neither moved nor
uttered any sound. I do not know whether or not
they have any name for death, but they surely know
what it is.</p>

<p>Moses was dead. His cold body lay in its usual
place, but was entirely covered over with the piece
of canvas kept in the cage for bed-clothing. I do
not know whether Aaron had covered him up or not,
but he seemed to realise the situation. I took him
by the hand and lifted him out of the cage, but he
was reluctant. I had the body removed and placed
on a bench about thirty feet away, in order to dissect
and prepare the skin and skeleton to preserve them.
When I proceeded to do this, I had Aaron confined
to the cage, lest he should annoy and hinder me at
the work; but he cried and fretted until he was
released.</p>

<p>It is not meant that he wept or shed tears over
the loss of his companion, for the lachrymal glands
and ducts are not developed in these apes; but they
manifest concern and regret which are motives of
the passion of sorrow, but being left alone was the
cause of this.</p>

<p>When released, he came and took his seat near
the dead body, where he sat the whole day long and
watched the operation.</p>

<p>After this he was never quiet for a moment if he
could see or hear me, until I secured another of his
kind for a companion; then his interest in me abated
in a measure, but his affection for me remained
intact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
His conduct towards Moses always impressed me
with the belief that he appreciated the fact that he
was in distress or pain, and while he may not have
foreseen the result, he certainly knew what death
was when he saw it. Whether it is instinct or
reason that causes man to shrink from death, the
same influence works to the same end in the ape;
and the demeanour of this same ape towards his
later companion, Elisheba, only confirmed the
opinion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />

<span class="subhead">AARON AND ELISHEBA</span></h2>

<p>Four days after the death of Moses I secured a
passage on a trading-boat that came into the lake.
It was a small affair, intended for towing canoes,
and not in any way prepared to carry passengers or
cargo; but I found room in one of the canoes to set
the cage I had provided for Aaron, stowed the rest
of my effects wherever space permitted, and embarked
for the coast.</p>

<p>Our progress was slow and the journey tedious,
as the only passage out of the lake at that season
was through a long, narrow, winding creek, beset
by sand-bars, rocks, logs, and snags, and in some
places overhung by low, bending trees. But the
wild, weird scenery was grand and beautiful. Long
lines of bamboo, broken here and there by groups of
pendanus or stately palms; islands of lilies and long
sweeps of papyrus, spreading away from the banks
on either side; the gorgeous foliage of aquatic plants
drooping along the margin like a massive fringe,
and relieved by clumps of tall, waving grass, formed
a perfect Eden for the birds and monkeys that dwell
among those scenes of an eternal summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
After a delay of eight days at Cape Lopez, we
secured passage on a small French gunboat, called
the <i class="ship">Komo</i>, by which we came to Gaboon, where I
found another <i xml:lang="nkq" lang="nkq">kulu-kamba</i> in the hands of a generous
friend, Mr. Adolph Strohm, who presented her to
me; and I gave her to Aaron as a wife, and called
her Elisheba, after the name of the wife of the great
high-priest.</p>

<p>Elisheba was captured on the head-waters of the
Mguni river, in about the same latitude that Aaron
was found in, but more than a hundred miles to the
east of that point and a few minutes north of it. I
did not learn the history of her capture.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find any two human beings
more unlike in taste and temperament than these
two apes were. Aaron was one of the most amiable
of creatures; he was affectionate and faithful to
those who treated him kindly; he was merry and
playful by nature, and often evinced a marked sense
of humour; he was fond of human society, and
strongly averse to solitude or confinement.</p>

<p>Elisheba was a perfect shrew, and often reminded
me of certain women that I have seen who had soured
on the world. She was treacherous, ungrateful, and
cruel in every thought and act; she was utterly devoid
of affection; she was selfish, sullen, and morose at all
times; she was often vicious and always obstinate;
she was indifferent to caresses, and quite as well
content when alone as in the best of company.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_119" src="images/i_119.jpg" width="600" height="376" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">A NATIVE CANOE</div></div>

<p>It is true that she was in poor health, and had
been badly treated before she fell into my hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
but she was by nature endowed with a bad temper
and depraved instincts.</p>

<p>It is not at all rare to see a vast difference of
manners, intelligence, and temperament among
specimens that belong to one species. In these
respects they vary as much in proportion to their
mental scope as human beings do; but I have never
seen, in any two apes of the same species, the two
extremes so widely removed from one another.</p>

<p>While waiting at Gaboon for a steamer I had my
own cage erected for them to live in, as it was large
and gave them ample room for play and exercise.
In one corner of it was suspended a small, cosy
house for them to sleep in. It was furnished with
a good supply of clean straw and some pieces of
canvas for bed-clothes. In the centre of the cage
was a swing, or trapeze, for them to use at their
pleasure.</p>

<p>Aaron found this a means of amusement, and
often indulged in a series of gymnastics that would
evoke the envy of the king of athletic sports. Elisheba
had no taste for such pastime, but her
depravity could never resist the impulse to interrupt
him in his jolly exercise. She would climb up and
contend for possession of the swing until she would
drive him away, when she would perch herself on
it and sit there for a time in stolid content, but would
neither swing nor play.</p>

<p>Frequently, when Aaron would lie down quietly
on the straw during the day, she would go into
the snug little house and raise a row with him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
pulling the straw from under him, handful at a time,
and throwing it out of the box till there was not one
left in it.</p>

<p>No matter what kind or quantity of food was
given them, she always wanted the piece he had,
and would fuss with him to get it; but when she got
it, she would sit holding it in her hand without eating
it, for there were some things that he liked which she
would not eat at all.</p>

<p>When we went out for a walk, no matter which
way we started she always contended to go some
other way; and if I yielded, she would again change
her mind, and start off in some other direction. If
forced to submit, she would scream and struggle as
if for life.</p>

<p>I cannot forego the belief that these freaks were
due to a base and perverse nature, and I could find
no higher motive in her stubborn conduct.</p>

<p>Aaron was very fond of her, and rarely ever
opposed her inflexible will. He clung to her, and
let her lead the way. I have often felt vexed at him
because he complied so readily with her wishes.</p>

<p>The only case in which he took sides against her
was in her conduct towards me.</p>

<p>When I first secured her she had the temper of a
demon, and with the smallest pretext she would
assault me and try to bite me or tear my clothes.
In these attacks Aaron was always with me, and the
loyal little champion would fly at her in the greatest
fury. He would strike her over the head and back
with his hands, bite her, and flog her till she desisted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
If she returned the blow he would grasp
her hand and bite it, or strike her in the face. He
would continue to fight till she submitted, when he
would celebrate his victory by jumping up and down
in a most grotesque fashion, stamping his feet,
slapping his hands on the ground, and grinning
like a mask. He seemed as conscious of what he
had done and as proud of it as any human could
have been; but no matter what she did to others,
he was always on her side of the question. If any
one else annoyed her, he would always resent it with
violence.</p>

<p>About the premises there were natives all the
time passing to and fro, and these two little captives
were objects of special interest to them. They
would stand by the cage hour after hour and watch
them. The ruling impulse of nearly every native
appears to be cruelty, and they cannot resist the
temptation to tease and torture anything that is not
able to retaliate. They were so persistent in poking
my chimpanzees with sticks, that I had to keep a
boy on watch all the time to prevent it; but the boy
could not be trusted, so I had to watch him.</p>

<p>In the rear of the room that I occupied was a
window through which I watched the boy and the
natives both from time to time, and when anything
went wrong I would call out from there to the boy.
Aaron soon observed this, and found that he could
get my attention himself by calling out when any
one annoyed him, and he also knew that the boy
was put there as a protector. Whenever any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the natives came about the cage he would call for
me in his peculiar manner, which I well understood
and promptly responded to. The boy also knew
what it meant, and would rush to the rescue. If I
were away from the house and the boy was aware
of the fact, he was apt to be tardy in coming to the
relief of the ape, and sometimes did not come at all,
in which event the two would crawl into their house
and pull down the curtain so that they could not be
seen. Here they would remain until the natives
would leave or some one came to their aid. Neither
of them ever resented anything the natives did to
them unless they could see me about, but whenever
I came in sight they would make battle with their
tormentors, and if liberated from the big cage,
they would chase the last one of them out of the
yard.</p>

<p>Aaron knew perfectly well that they were not
allowed to molest him or his companion, and when
he knew that he had my support he was ready to
carry on the war to a finish. But it was really
funny to see how meek and patient he was when
left alone to defend himself against the natives with
a stick, and then to note the change in him when he
knew that he was backed up by a friend upon whom
he could rely.</p>

<p>Mr. Strohm, the trader with whom I found hospitality
at this place, kept a cow in the lot where the
cage was. She was a small black animal, and the
first that Aaron had ever seen. He never ceased to
contemplate her with wonder and with fear. If she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
came near the cage when no one was about he
hurried into his box, and from there peeped out in
silence until she went away. The cow was equally
amazed at the cage and its strange occupants, though
less afraid, and frequently came near to inspect them.
She would stand a few yards away with her head
lifted high, her eyes arched and ears thrown forward,
waiting for them to come out of that mysterious box;
but they would not venture out of their asylum while
she remained, until tired of waiting she would switch
her tail, shake her head, and turn away.</p>

<p>When taken out of the cage, Aaron had special
delight in driving the cow away, and if she was
around he would grasp me by the hand and start
towards her. He would stamp the ground with his
foot, strike with all force with his long arm, slap the
ground with his hand, and scream at her at the top
of his voice. If she moved away, he would let go
my hand and rush towards her as though he intended
to tear her up; but if the cow turned suddenly
towards him, the little fraud would run to me, grasp
my leg, and scream with fright.</p>

<p>The cow was afraid of a man, and as long as she
was followed by one she would continue to go; but
when she would discover the ape to be alone in
the pursuit, she would turn and look as if trying to
determine what manner of thing it was. Elisheba
never seemed to take any special notice of the cow
except when she approached too near the cage, and
then it was due to the conduct of Aaron that she
made any fuss about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
On board the steamer that we sailed in for home,
there was a young elephant that was sent by a trader
for sale. He was kept in a strong stall, built on
deck for his quarters. There were wide cracks
between the boards, and the elephant had the habit
of reaching his trunk through them in search of
anything he might find. With his long, flexible
proboscis extended from the side of the stall, he
would twist and coil it in all manner of writhing
forms. This was the crowning terror of the
lives of those two apes: it was the bogie-man of
their existence, and nothing could induce either of
them to go near it. If they saw me go about it, they
would scream and yell until I came away. If Aaron
could get hold of me without getting too near it, he
would cling to me until he would almost tear my
clothes to keep me away from it. It was the one
thing that Elisheba was afraid of, and the only one
against which she ever gave me warning.</p>

<p>They did not manifest the same concern for
others, but sat watching them without offering any
protest. Even the stowaway who fed them and
attended to their cage was permitted to approach it,
but their solicitude for me was remarked by every
man on board.</p>

<p>I was never able to tell what their opinion was of
the thing. They were much less afraid of the
elephant when they could see all of him, than they
were of the trunk when they saw that alone. They
may have thought the latter to be a big snake, but
such is only conjecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
At the beginning of the voyage I took six panels
of my own cage and made a small cage for them. I
taught them to drink water from a beer-bottle with a
long neck that could be put through a mesh of the
wires. They preferred this mode of drinking, and
appeared to look upon it as an advanced idea.
Elisheba always insisted on being served first, and
being a female her wish was complied with. When
she had finished, Aaron would climb up by the wires
and take his turn. There is a certain sound or word
which the chimpanzee always uses to express "good"
or "satisfaction," and he made frequent use of it.
He would drink a few swallows of the water and
then utter the sound, whereupon Elisheba would
climb up again and taste it. She seemed to think it
was something better than she was drinking, but
finding it the same as she had had, she would again
give way for him. Every time he would use the
sound she would take another taste and turn away,
but she never failed to try it if he uttered the
sound.</p>

<p>The boy who cared for them on the voyage was
disposed to play tricks on them, and one of these
ugly pranks was to turn the bottle up so that when
they had finished drinking and took their lips away,
the water would spill out and run down over them.
For a time or two they declined to drink from the
bottle while he was holding it, but when he let it
go it would hang in such a position that they could
not get the water out of it at all. At length Aaron
solved the problem by climbing up one side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
cage, and getting on a level with the bottle, reached
across the angle formed by the two sides of the cage
and drank. In this position it was no matter to him
how much the water ran out, it couldn't touch him.
Elisheba watched him until she quite grasped the
idea, when she climbed up in the same manner and
slaked her thirst.</p>

<p>I scolded the boy for serving them with such cruel
tricks, but it taught me another lesson of value
concerning the mental resources of the chimpanzee,
for no philosopher could have found a much better
scheme to obviate the trouble than did this cunning
little sage in the hour of necessity.</p>

<p>I have never regarded the training of animals as
the true measure of their mental powers, but the real
test is to reduce the animal to his own resources, and
see how he will render himself under conditions that
present new problems. Animals may be taught to
do many things in a mechanical way, and without
any motive that relates to the action; but when they
can work out the solution without the aid of man,
it is only the faculty of reason that can guide them.</p>

<p>One thing that Aaron could never figure out was
what became of the chimpanzee that he saw in a
mirror. I have seen him hunt for that mysterious
ape for an hour at a time, and he broke a piece off
a mirror I had in trying to find it, but he never
succeeded.</p>

<p>I have held the glass firmly before him, and he
would put his face up close to it, sometimes almost
in contact. He would quietly gaze at the image, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
then reach his hand around the glass to feel for it.
Not finding it, he would peep around the side of it
and then look into it again. He would take hold of
it and turn it around; lay it on the ground, look at
the image again, and put his hand under the edge of
it. The look of inquiry in that quaint face was so
striking as to make one pity him. But he was hard
to discourage, and continued the search whenever
he had the mirror.</p>

<p>Elisheba never worried herself much about it.
When she saw the image in the glass she seemed to
recognise it as one of her kind, but when it would
vanish she let it go without trying to find it. In fact,
she often turned away from it as though she did not
admire it. She rarely ever took hold of the glass,
and never felt behind it for the other ape.</p>

<p>Altogether she was an odd specimen of her tribe,
eccentric and whimsical beyond anything I have ever
known among animals, yet with all her freaks Aaron
was fond of her, and she afforded him company; but
he was extremely jealous of her, and permitted no
stranger to take any liberties with her with impunity.
He did not object to them doing so with him, and
rarely took offence at any degree of familiarity, for
he would make friends with any one who was gentle
with him, but he could not tolerate their doing so
with her.</p>

<p>She betrayed no sign of affection for him except
when some one annoyed or vexed him, but in that
event she never failed to take his part against all
odds. At such times she would become frantic with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
rage, and if the cause was prolonged, she would
often refuse to eat for hours afterwards.</p>

<p>On the voyage homeward, there was another
chimpanzee on board, belonging to a sailor who was
bringing him home for sale. He was about two
years older than Aaron and fully twice as large. He
was tame and gentle, but was kept in a close cage to
himself. He saw the others roaming about the deck
and tried to make up with them, but they evinced no
desire to become intimate with one who was confined
in such a manner.</p>

<p>One bright Sunday morning, as we rode the calm
waters near the Canary Islands, I induced the sailor
to release his prisoner on the main deck with my
own, and see how they would act towards each other.
He did so, and in a moment the big ape came
ambling along the deck towards Aaron and Elisheba,
who were sitting on the top of a hatch and absorbed
in gnawing some turkey bones.</p>

<p>As the stranger came near he slackened his pace
and gazed earnestly at the others. Aaron ceased
eating and stared at the visitor with a look of surprise,
but Elisheba barely noticed him. He scanned Aaron
from head to foot, and Aaron did the same with him.
He advanced until his nose almost touched that of
Aaron, and in this position the two remained for
some seconds, when the big one proceeded to salute
Elisheba in the same manner, but she gave him little
attention. She continued to gnaw the bone in her
hand, and he had no reason to feel flattered at the
impression he appeared to have made on her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Aaron watched him with deep concern, but without
uttering a sound.</p>

<p>Turning again to Aaron, he reached out for his
turkey bone; but the hospitality of the little host was
not equal to the demand, and he drew back with a
shrug of his shoulder, holding the bone closer to
himself and then resumed eating.</p>

<p>A bone was then given to the visitor by a steward,
and he climbed upon the hatch and took a seat on
the right of Elisheba, while Aaron was seated to her
left. As soon as the big one had taken his seat,
Aaron resigned his place and crowded himself in
between them. The three sat for a few moments in
this order, when the big one got up and deliberately
walked around to the other side of Elisheba and sat
down again beside her. Again Aaron forced himself
in between them.</p>

<p>This act was repeated six or eight times, when
Elisheba left the hatch and took a seat on a spar
that lay on deck. The big ape immediately moved
over and sat down near her; but by the time he was
seated Aaron again got in between them, and as he
did so he struck his rival a smart blow on the back.
They sat in this manner for a minute or so, when
Aaron drew back his hand and struck him again.
He continued his blows all the while, increasing
them in force and frequency, but the other did not
resent them. His manner was one of dignified contempt,
as if he regarded the inferior strength of his
assailant unworthy of his own prowess.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to suppose that he was constrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
by any principle of honour, but his demeanour
was patronising and forbearing, like that of a considerate
man towards a small boy.</p>

<p>One amusing feature of the affair was the half-serious
and half-jocular manner of Aaron. He did
not turn his face to look at his rival as he struck,
and the instant the blow was delivered he withdrew
his hand as if to avoid being detected. He gave no
sign of anger, but made no effort to conceal his
jealousy, and the other seemed to be aware of the
cause of his disquietude. The smirk of indifference
on the little lover's face belied the state of mind that
impelled his action, and it was patent to all who
witnessed the tilt that Aaron was jealous of his
guest.</p>

<p>From time to time Elisheba would change her
seat, when the same scene would ensue.</p>

<p>The whole affair was comical and yet so real, that
one could not repress the laughter it evoked. It
was the drama of "love's young dream" in real life,
in which every man, at some period of his young
career, has played each part the same as these two
rivals. Every detail of plot and line was the duplicate
of a like incident in the experience of boyhood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;"><img id="i_133" src="images/i_133.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">AARON AND ELISHEBA</div></div>

<p>Elisheba did not appear to encourage the suit of
this simian beau, but she did not rebuff him as a
true and faithful spouse should do, and I never
blamed Aaron for not liking it. She had no right
to tolerate the attentions of a total stranger; but she
was feminine, and perhaps endowed with all the
vanity of her sex and fond of adulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
However, my sympathies for the devoted little
Aaron were too strong for me to permit him to be
imposed upon by a rival, who was twice as big and
three times as strong as he was, so I took him and
Elisheba away on the after deck, where they had a
good time alone.</p>

<p>Elisheba was never very much devoted to me,
but in the early part of her career she began to realise
the fact that I was her master and her friend. She
had no gratitude in her nature, but she had sense
enough to see that all her food and comfort were due
to me, and as a matter of policy she became submissive,
but never tractable. She was doubtless a
plebeian among her own race, and was not capable
of being brought up to a high standard of culture.
She could not be controlled by kindness alone, for
she was by nature sordid and perverse. I was
never cruel or severe in dealing with her, but it was
necessary to be strict and firm. Her poor health,
however, often caused me to indulge her in whims
that otherwise would have brought her under a more
rigid discipline; and the patient conduct of Aaron
appeared to be tempered by the same consideration.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE DEATH OF AARON AND ELISHEBA</span></h2>

<p>At the end of forty-two long days at sea we arrived
at Liverpool. It was near the end of autumn.
The weather was cold and foggy. Elisheba was
failing in health, as I feared she would do in coming
from the warm, humid climate along the equator,
and, at the same time, having to undergo a change
of food.</p>

<p>On arriving at the end of our long and arduous
voyage, I secured quarters for them, and quickly
had them stowed away in a warm, sunny cage.
Elisheba began to recover from the fatigue and
worry of the journey, and for a time was more
cheerful than she had been since I had known her.
Her appetite returned, the symptoms of fever
passed away, and she seemed benefited by the
voyage rather than injured. Aaron was in the best
of health, and had shown no signs of any evil
results from the trip.</p>

<p>On reaching the landing-stage in Liverpool, some
friends who met us there expressed a desire to see
them, and I opened their cage in the waiting-room
for that purpose. When they beheld the throng of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
huge figures with white faces, long skirts and big
coats, they were almost frantic with fear. They
had never before seen anything like it, and they
crouched back in the corner of the cage, clinging to
each other and screaming in terror.</p>

<p>When they saw me standing by them they rushed
to me, seized me by the legs, and climbed up to my
arms. Finding they were safe here, they stared for
a moment, as if amazed at the crowd, and then Elisheba
buried her face under my chin, and refused to
look at any one. They were both trembling with
fright, and I could scarcely get them into their cage
again; but after they were installed in their quarters
with Dr. Cross, they became reconciled to the sight
of strangers in such costumes.</p>

<p>In their own country they had never seen anything
like this, for the natives to whom they were
accustomed wear no clothing as a rule, except a
small piece of cloth tied round the waist, and the
few white men they had seen were mostly dressed
in white; but here was a great crowd in skirts and
overcoats, and I have no doubt that to them it was
a startling sight for the first time.</p>

<p>During the first two weeks after arriving at this
place, Elisheba improved in health and temper until
she was not like the same creature; but about that
time she contracted a severe cold. A deep, dry cough,
attended by pains in the chest and sides, together
with a piping hoarseness, betrayed the nature of her
disease, and gave just cause for apprehension.</p>

<p>During frequent paroxysms of coughing she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
pressed her hands upon her breast or side to arrest
the shock, and thus lessen the pain it caused.
When quiet, she sat holding her hands on her
throat, her head bowed down, and her eyes drooping
or closed. Day by day the serpent of disease
drew his deadly coils closer and closer about her
wasting form, but she bore it with a patience
worthy of a human being.</p>

<p>The sympathy and forbearance of Aaron were
again called into action, and the demand was not in
vain. Hour after hour he sat with her locked in
his arms, as he is seen in the portrait given herewith.
He was not posing for a picture, nor was he
aware how deeply his manners touched the human
heart. Even the brawny men who work about the
place paused to watch him in his tender offices to
her, and his staid keeper was moved to pity by his
kindness and his patience.</p>

<p>For days she lingered on the verge of death.
She became too feeble to sit up, but as she lay on
her bed of straw, he sat by her side, resting his
folded arms upon her, and refusing to allow any one
to touch her. His look of deep concern showed
that he felt the gravity of her case, in a degree that
bordered on grief. He was grave and silent, as if
he foresaw the sad end that was near at hand. My
frequent visits were a source of comfort to him, and
he evinced a pleasure in my coming that bespoke
his confidence in me and faith in my ability to
relieve his suffering companion; but, alas! she was
beyond the aid of human skill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
On the morning of her decease, I found him sitting
by her as usual. At my approach he quietly
rose to his feet, and advanced to the front of the
cage. Opening the door, I put my arm in and
caressed him. He looked into my face, and then
at the prostrate form of his mate. The last dim
sparks of life were not yet gone out, as the slight
motion of the breast betrayed, but the limbs were
cold and limp. While I leaned over to examine
more closely, he crouched down by her side and
watched with deep concern to see the result. I laid
my hand upon her heart to ascertain if the last hope
was gone; he looked at me, and then placed his
own hand by the side of mine, and held it there as
if he knew the purport of the act.</p>

<p>Of course, to him this had no real meaning, but
it was an index to the desire which prompted it.
He seemed to think that anything that I did would
be good for her, and his purpose, doubtless, was to
aid me. When I removed my hand, he removed
his; when I returned mine, he did the same; and
to the last gave evidence of his faith in my friendship
and good intentions. His ready approval of
anything I did showed that he had a vague idea of
my purpose.</p>

<p>At length the breast grew still and the feeble
beating of the heart ceased. The lips were parted
and the dim eyes were half-way closed, but he sat
by as if she were asleep. The sturdy keeper came
to remove the body from the cage; but Aaron
clung to it, and refused to allow him to touch it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
took the little mourner in my arms, but he watched
the keeper jealously, and did not want him to
remove or disturb the body. It was laid on a
bunch of straw in front of the cage and he was
returned to his place, but he clung to me so firmly
that it was difficult to release his hold. He cried
in a piteous tone, fretted and worried, as if he fully
realised the worst. The body was then removed
from view, but poor little Aaron was not consoled.
How I pitied him! How I wished that he was
again in his native land, where he might find friends
of his own race!</p>

<p>After this, he grew more attached to me than
ever, and when I went to visit him he was happy
and cheerful in my presence; but the keeper said
that while I was away he was often gloomy and
morose. As long as he could see me or hear my
voice, he would fret and cry for me to come to him.
When I would leave him, he would scream as long
as he had any hope of inducing me to return.</p>

<p>A few days after the death of Elisheba, the keeper
put a young monkey in the cage with him for
company. This gave him some relief from the
monotony of his own society, but never quite filled
the place of the lost one. With this little friend,
however, he amused himself in many ways. He
nursed it so zealously and hugged it so tightly that
the poor little monkey was often glad to escape from
him in order to have a rest. But the task of catching
it again afforded him almost as much pleasure as
he found in nursing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Thus he passed his time for a few weeks, when he
was seized by a sudden cold, which in a few days
developed into an acute type of pneumonia.</p>

<p>I was in London at the time and was not aware
of this, but, feeling anxious about him, I wrote to
Dr. Cross, in whose care he was left, and received a
note in reply, stating that Aaron was very ill, and
not expected to live. I prepared to go to visit him
the next day, but just before I left the hotel I
received a telegram stating that he was dead.</p>

<p>The news contained in the letter was a greater
shock to me than that in the telegram, for which,
in part, the former had prepared me; but no one can
imagine how deeply these evil tidings affected me.
I could not bring myself to a full sense of the fact.
I was unwilling to believe that I was thus deprived
of my devoted friend. I could not realise that
fate would be so cruel to me; but, alas! it was
true.</p>

<p>Not being present during his short illness or at
the time of his death, I cannot relate any of the
scenes attending them; but the kind old keeper who
attended him declares that he never became reconciled
to the death of Elisheba, and that his
loneliness preyed upon him almost as much as the
disease.</p>

<p>When I looked upon his cold, lifeless body, I felt
that I was indeed bereft of one of the dearest and
one of the most loyal pets that any mortal had ever
known. His fidelity to me had been shown in a
hundred ways, and his affections had never wavered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
How could any one requite such integrity with anything
unkind?</p>

<p>To those who possess the higher instincts of
humanity, it will not be thought absurd in me to
confess that the conduct of these creatures awoke in
me a feeling more exalted than a mere sense of
kindness. It touched some chord of nature that
yields a richer tone; but only those who have known
such pets as I have known them can feel towards
them as I have felt.</p>

<p>I have no desire to bias the calm judgment or
bribe the sentiment of him who scorns the love of
nature, by clothing these humble creatures in the
garb of human dignity; but to him who is not so
imbued with self-conceit as to be blind to all
evidence and deaf to all reason, it must appear that
they are gifted with like faculties and passions to
those of man; differing in degree, but not in kind.</p>

<p>Moved by such conviction, who could fail to pity
that poor, lone captive, in his iron cell, far from his
native land, slowly dying? It may be a mere freak
of sentiment that I regret not being with him to
soothe and comfort his last hours, but I do regret
it deeply. He had the right to expect it of me, as
a duty.</p>

<p>Poor little Aaron! In the brief span of half a
year he had seen his own mother die at the hands
of the cruel hunters; he had been seized and sold
into captivity; he had seen the lingering torch of
life go out of the frail body of Moses; he had
watched the demon of death bind his cold shackles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
on Elisheba; and now he had, himself, passed
through the deep shadows of that ordeal.</p>

<p>What a sad and vast experience for one short
year! He had shared with me the toils and dangers
of the sea and land over many a weary mile. He
seemed to feel that the death of his two friends was
a common loss to us; and if there is any one thing
which more than another knits the web of sympathy
about two alien hearts, it is the experience of a
common grief.</p>

<p>Thus ended the career of my <i xml:lang="nkq" lang="nkq">kulu-kamba</i> friend,
the last of my chimpanzee pets. In him were
centred many cherished hopes, but they did not
perish with him, for I shall some day find another
one of his kind in whom I may realise all that I had
hoped for in him; but I cannot expect to find a
specimen of superior qualities, for he was certainly
one of the jolliest and one of the wisest of his race.</p>

<p>However fine and intelligent his successor may
be, he can never supplant either Moses or Aaron
in my affections: for these two little heroes shared
with me so many of the sad vicissitudes of time
and fortune that I should be an ingrate to forget
them or allow the deeds of others to dim the glory
of their memory.</p>

<p>I have all of them preserved, and when I look at
them the past comes back to me, and I recall so
vividly the scenes in which they played the leading
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôles</i>&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;it is like a panorama of their lives.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />

<span class="subhead">OTHER CHIMPANZEES</span></h2>

<p>Among the number of chimpanzees that I have
seen are some whose actions are worthy of record;
but as many of them were the repetition of similar
acts of other specimens which are elsewhere described,
we shall omit them, and relate only such
other acts as may tend to widen the circle of our
knowledge, and more fully illustrate the mental range
of this interesting tribe of apes.</p>

<p>In passing through the country of the Esyira tribe,
I came to a small village where I halted for a rest.
On entering the open space between two rows of
bamboo huts, I saw a group of native children at
the opposite end of the space, and among them a
fine big chimpanzee, who was sharing with them in
their play.</p>

<p>When they discovered the presence of a white
man in the town, they left their sport and came to
inspect me. The ape also came, and he showed as
much interest in the matter as any one else did. I
was seated in a native chair in front of the king's
hut, and the people, as usual, stood around me at a
respectful distance, looking on as if I had been some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
wild beast captured in the jungle. The ape was
aware that I was not a familiar kind of thing, and
he appeared in doubt as to how he should act towards
me. He sat down on the ground among the
people, and stared at me in surprise, from time to
time glancing at those around him as if to ascertain
what they thought of me. As they became satisfied
with looking, they retired one by one from the
scene, until most of them had gone, but the ape
remained. He changed his place a few times, but
only to get a better view. The people were amused
at his manner, but no one molested him.</p>

<p>At length I spoke to him in his own language,
using the sound which they use for calling one
another. He looked as if he knew what it meant
but made no reply. I repeated the sound, when he
rose up and stood on his feet as if he intended to
come to me. Again I uttered it, and he came a few
feet closer, but shied to one side as if to flank my
position and get behind me. He stopped again to
look, and I repeated the word, in response to which
he came up near my right side, and began to examine
my clothing. He plucked at my coat-sleeve a few
times, then at the leg of my trousers and at the top
of my boot. He was getting rather familiar for a
stranger, but I felt myself to blame for having given
him the license to do so. For a while he continued
his investigations, then deliberately put his left hand
on my right shoulder, his right foot on my knee, and
climbed into my lap. He now began to examine
my helmet, ears, nose, chin and mouth. He became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
a little rough, and I tried to get him down out of my
lap, but he was not disposed to go. Finally, I told
my boy, who acted as interpreter, to tell the native
lads to come and take him away. This amused
them very much, for they saw that I was bigger than
the ape, and thought I ought therefore to manage
him myself. They complied, however, but his
apeship declined to go until one of the men of the
town interfered and compelled him to do so.</p>

<p>As he got down from my lap, one of the boys
bantered him to play. He accepted the challenge,
and ran after the lad until they reached the end of
the open space between the houses, when the boy
fell upon the ground and the ape fell on him. They
rolled and wallowed on the ground for a time, when
the ape released himself and ran away to the other
end of the opening, the boy pursuing him. When
they reached the end of the street, they again fell
upon each other and another scuffle ensued. It was
plain to be seen that the boy could run much faster
than the ape, but he did not try to elude him.</p>

<p>The other children crowded around them or
followed them, looking on, laughing and shouting in
the greatest glee. First one boy and then another
took his turn in the play, but the ape did not lose
interest in me. He stopped from time to time to
take another survey, but did not try again to get
upon my lap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_147" src="images/i_147.jpg" width="600" height="435" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">NATIVE VILLAGE AT MOILE&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;INTERIOR OF NYANZA</div></div>

<p>After a long time at this sport, the ape quit
playing and sat down by the wall of a house, with
his back against it; the children tried in vain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
induce him to resume, but he firmly declined, and
sat there like a tired athlete, picking his teeth with
a bamboo splinter, which he had pulled off the side
of the house.</p>

<p>His conduct was so much like that of the children
with whom he was playing, that one could not have
distinguished him from them except by his physique.
He enjoyed the game as much as they did, and
showed that he knew how to gain or use an
advantage over his adversary. In a scuffle he was
stronger and more active than the boys, but in the
race they were the more fleet. He screamed and
yelled with delight, and in every way appeared to
enter into the spirit of the fun.</p>

<p>He was about five years old, and his history, as it
was given to me, was that he had been captured when
quite young in the forest near that place and ever
since that time had lived in the village. He had
been the constant playmate of the children, ate with
them, and slept in the same houses with them. He
was perfectly tame and harmless; he knew every one
in the village by name, and knew his own name.</p>

<p>The king's son, to whom he belonged, assured me
that the ape could talk, and that he himself could
understand what he said; but he declined to gratify
my request to hear it. However, he called the ape
by name, and told him to come to him, which he
obeyed. He then gave him a long-necked gourd,
and told him to go to the spring and bring some
water. The animal hesitated, but on repeating the
command two or three times, he reluctantly obeyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
After a few minutes he returned with the gourd
about half filled with water. In carrying the vessel
he held it by the neck, but this deprived him of the
use of one hand. He waddled along on his feet,
using the other hand, but now and then would set
the gourd on the ground, still holding to it, and
using it something after the manner of a short stick.
On delivering the gourd of water to his master, he
gave evidence of knowing that he had done a clever
thing. I expressed a desire to see him fill the gourd
at the spring. The water was then emptied out,
and the gourd again given to him. On this occasion
we followed him to the place where he got the water.
On arriving, he leaned over the spring and pressed
the gourd into the water, but the mouth of it was
turned down so that the water could not flow into it.
As he lifted the gourd out, it turned to one side and
a small quantity flowed into it. He repeated the act
a number of times, and seemed to know how it
ought to be done, although he was very awkward in
doing it. Whenever the water in the mouth of the
gourd would bubble, he would dip it back again and
was evidently aware that it was not filled. Finally,
raising the vessel, he turned and offered it to his
master, who declined to relieve him of it. We
turned to go back into the town, and the ape followed
us with the gourd, but all the way along continued
to mutter a sound of complaint.</p>

<p>He next sent him into the edge of the forest to
bring firewood. He was only gone a few minutes
when he returned with a small branch of dead wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
which he had picked up on the ground. He again
sent him, together with three or four children.
When he returned on this occasion he had three
sticks in his hand. The man explained to me that,
when the ape went alone he would never bring but
one twig at a time, and this was sometimes not
bigger than a lead-pencil; but if the children went
with him and brought wood, he would bring as
much as he could grasp in one hand. He also told
me that the animal would sit down on the ground
and lay the sticks across one arm in the same
manner as the children did, but invariably dropped
them when he would rise up. Then he would seize
what he could in one hand, and bring it along. He
also said, that in carrying a single stick the ape
always used the hand in which he held it; but if he
had three or four pieces that he always curved his
arm inwards, holding the wood against his side,
and hobbled along with his feet and the other
hand.</p>

<p>The next thing with which he entertained me was
sending the ape to call some one in the village. He
first sent him to bring a certain one of the man's
wives. She was several doors away from where we
sat. The ape went to one house, sat down at the
door for a moment, looking inside, and then moved
slowly along to the next, which he entered. Within
a minute he appeared at the door holding the cloth
that the woman wore tied around her, and in
this manner led her to his master. He next sent
him to bring a certain boy, which he did in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
similar manner, except that the boy had on no clothing
of any kind, and the ape held him by the leg.</p>

<p>During all these feats the man talked to him, as
far as I could tell, in the native language only,
though he declared to me that some of the words
that he had used were those of the ape's own speech.
However, he said that many words that the ape
knew were of the native speech, and that the ape
had no such words in his language. One thing that
especially impressed me was a sound which I have
elsewhere described as meaning "good" or "satisfaction,"
which this man said was the word which
these apes use to mean "mother." My own servant
had told me the same thing before, but I am still of
the opinion that they are mistaken in the meaning
of the sound, although it is almost exactly the same
as the word for mother in the native speech. The
difference being in the vowel element only, and it is
possible, I grant, that the word may have both
meanings. A little later one of the women came to
the door of a house and said, in the native language,
that something was ready to eat, whereupon the
children and the ape at once started. In the meantime
she set an earthen pot, containing boiled
plantains, in front of the house, from which all the
children and the ape alike helped themselves. In
brief, the ape was a part of the family, and was so
regarded by all in the town.</p>

<p>I do not know to what extent they may have played
upon my credulity, but, so far as I could discern, their
statements concerning the animal were verified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
I proposed to buy the ape, but the price asked
was nearly twice that of a slave, and I could have
bought any child in the town at a smaller cost. I
have never seen any other chimpanzee that I so
much coveted. When standing in an upright position,
he was quite four feet in height, strongly built,
and well-proportioned. He was in a fine, healthy
condition, and in the very prime of his life. He
was not handsome in the face, but his coat of hair
was of good colour and texture. He was of the
common variety, but a fine specimen.</p>

<p>Mr. Otto Handmann, formerly the German consul
at Gaboon, had a very fair specimen of this same
species of chimpanzee. He was a rough, burly
creature, but was well-disposed and had in his face a
look of wisdom that was almost comical. He had
been for some months a captive in a native town,
during which time he had become quite tame and
docile. By nature he was not humorous, but appeared
to acquire a sense of fun as he grew older
and became more familiar with the manners of
men.</p>

<p>On my return from the interior, I was invited by
the consul to take breakfast with himself and a few
friends; but owing to a prior engagement I was not
able to be present. It was proposed by some one
of the guests present that my vacant seat at the
table should be filled by the chimpanzee. He was
brought into the room and permitted to occupy the
seat. He behaved himself with becoming gravity,
and was not abashed in the presence of so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
guests. He was served with such things as were
best suited to his liking, and his demeanour was
such as to amuse all present. On proposing a toast,
all the guests beat with their hands upon the table,
and in this the chimpanzee joined with apparent
pleasure. After a few rounds of this kind, one of
the guests, occupying the seat next to him, failed to
respond with the usual beating; the chimpanzee
observed the fact, turned upon the guest, and
began to claw, scream, and pound him on the
back and arm until the gentleman proceeded to
beat, whereupon the ape resumed his place and
joined in the applause. On this occasion he
acquitted himself with credit, but an hour later he
had fallen into disgrace by drinking beer until he
was actually drunk, when he awkwardly climbed off
the chair, crawled under the table, and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>One of the clerks in the employ of the consul also
had a fair specimen of this same species. It was
a female, perhaps two years younger than the one
just described, but equally addicted to the habit of
drinking beer. It is the custom among people on
the coast to offer to a guest something to drink, and
on these occasions this young lady ape always expected
to partake with others. If she was overlooked
in pouring out beer for others, she always set
up a complaint until she got her glass. If it was
not given to her, she would go from one to another,
holding out her hand and begging for a drink. If
she failed to secure it, she would watch her opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and while the guest was not looking, would
stealthily reach up, take his glass off the table, drink
the contents, and return the glass to its place. She
would do this with each one in turn, until she had
taken the last glass; but if a glass was given to her
at the same time that the others were served, she
was content with it and made no attempt to steal
that of another.</p>

<p>In this act she evinced a skill and caution worthy
of a confirmed thief; she would secrete herself
under the table or behind a chair, and watch her
chance. She made no attempt to steal the glass
while it was being watched, but the instant she
discovered that she was not observed, or thought
she was not, the theft was committed.</p>

<p>Her master frequently gave her a glass and bottle
of beer to help herself. She could pour the beer out
with dexterity. She often spilt a portion of it, and
sometimes filled the glass too full, but always set the
bottle right end up, lifted the glass with both hands,
drained it, and refilled it as long as there was any in
the bottle. She could also drink from the bottle,
and would resort to this if no glass was given her.
She knew an empty bottle from one that contained
beer.</p>

<p>This ape was very much attached to her master,
would follow him, and cry after him like a child.
She was affectionate to him, but had been so much
annoyed by strangers that her temper was spoiled
and she was irritable.</p>

<p>I may remark here, that I have known at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
five or six chimpanzees that were fond of beer, and
would drink it until they were drunk whenever they
could get it. I have never seen one, that I am aware
of, that would drink spirits.</p>

<p>Arriving on the south side of Lake Izanga, I
found a young chimpanzee at the house of a white
trader. It was tied to a post in the yard, where it
was annoyed by the natives who came to the place
to trade. On approaching it for the first time, I
spoke to it in its own language, using the word for
food. It recognised the sound at once and responded
to it. As I came nearer, it advanced as far
towards me as the string with which it was tied
would allow. Standing erect and holding out its
hands, it repeated the sound two or three times. I
gave it some dried fish which it ate with relish, and
we at once became friends. Its master permitted
me to release it on the condition that I should not
allow it to escape. I did so, and took the little captive
in my arms. It put its arms around my neck
as if I had been the only friend it had on earth. It
clung to me, and would not consent for me to leave
it. I could but pity the poor, neglected creature.
There it was, tied in the hot sun, hungry, lonely, and
exposed to the tortures of every heartless native that
chose to tease it. When it was not in my arms, it
followed me around and would not leave me for a
moment. Its master cared but little for it, and left
it to the charge of his boy, who, like all other natives,
had no thought or concern for the comfort of any
creature but himself. I tried to purchase it, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
price was too much, and after two days our friendship
was broken for ever. But I was glad to learn,
soon after this, that another trader secretly released
it, and let it escape into the forest. The man who
did this told me himself that he did it as an act of
mercy. I often recall this little prisoner to mind,
and always feel a sense of gladness at knowing that
he was set at liberty by a humane friend. Whatever
may have been his fate in the forest, it could
have been no worse than to be confined, starved, and
tormented as he was, while in captivity.</p>

<p>Another small specimen, which I saw at Gaboon,
was not of much value except from one fact, and
that was, it was broken out with an eruptive disease
prevalent among the natives. It is called crawcraw
or kra-kra. It is said to originate from the water,
either by external or internal use of it. This animal
was infected in the same way and on the same parts
of the body as men are affected by the same disease,
and is another instance of their being subject to the
same maladies as those of man. The specimen itself
also exemplified the difference in intellect among
these animals, for this one had in its face the look of
mental weakness, and every act confirmed the fact.
It was silent, inactive and obtuse.</p>

<p>During my residence in the cage I did not see so
many chimpanzees as I saw of gorillas, but from
those I did see it was an easy matter to determine
that they were much less shy and timid than the
gorilla.</p>

<p>On one occasion I heard one in the bush not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
away from the cage. I called him with the usual
sound and he answered, but did not come to the
cage. It is probable that he could see it, and was
afraid of it. I tried to induce Moses to call him, and
he did once utter the sound, but he appeared to
regret having made the attempt. I called again and
he answered, and from the manner in which Moses
behaved it was evident that he understood it. He
would not attempt the call again, but clung to my
neck with his face buried under my chin. It was
probably jealousy that caused him to refuse, because
he did not want the other to share my attentions.
I gave the food sound, but I could not induce the
visitor to come nearer. I failed to get a view of him
so as to tell how large he was, but from his voice he
must have been about grown. Whether he was
quite alone or not I was not able to tell, but only the
one voice could be heard.</p>

<p>Another time, while sitting quite alone, a young
chimpanzee, perhaps five or six years old, appeared
at the edge of a small opening of the bush. He
plucked a bud or leaf from a small plant. He
raised it to his nose and smelt it. He picked three
or four buds of different kinds, one or two of which
he put in his mouth. He turned aside the dead
leaves that were lying on the ground as if he expected
to find something under them. I spoke to him,
using the call sound; he instantly turned his eyes
towards me, but made no reply. I uttered the food
sound and he replied, but stood where he was. He
betrayed no sign of fear, and little of surprise. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
surveyed the cage and myself, and I repeated the
sound two or three times. He refused to approach
any nearer. He turned his head from side to side
for a moment as if in doubt which way to go; then
turned aside and disappeared in the bush. He did
not run or start away as if in great fear, but by the
sound of the shaking bushes it could be told that he
increased his speed after he once disappeared from
view.</p>

<p>One day I had been for a stroll with Moses and
the boy. As we returned to the cage we saw a
chimpanzee about half-grown; he was crossing the
rugged little path about thirty yards away from us.
He paused for a moment to look at us, and we stopped.
I tried to induce Moses to call out to him, but he declined
to do so. As the stranger turned aside I called
to him myself, but he neither stopped nor answered.
This one appeared to be quite brown, but the boy
assured me his hair was jet black, but his skin being
light gave him this colour. To satisfy myself, I had
Moses placed in the same place and position, and
looking at him from the same distance I was convinced
that the boy was right.</p>

<p>One morning, as I started with Moses for a walk,
I had only gone some forty yards away from the
cage when he made a sound of warning. I instantly
looked up, when I saw a large chimpanzee standing
in the bush not more than twenty yards away. I
paused to look at him. He stood for a moment,
looking straight at us. I spoke to him, but he made
no reply; he moved off almost parallel to the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
path which we were in, and I returned towards the
cage. He did not come any nearer to us, but kept
his course almost parallel with ours. He turned his
head from time to time to look, but gave no sign of
attack. I called to him several times, but he made
no answer. When I reached a place in front of the
cage I called again, and after the lapse of a few
seconds he stopped. By this time he was concealed
from view. He only halted for a moment, changed
his course and resumed his journey. This was the
largest one I saw in the forest.</p>

<p>At another time, while sitting in the cage, I heard
the sound of something making its way through the
bush not more than twenty yards away; presently it
passed in view. As it crossed the path near by, I
called three or four times, but it neither stopped nor
answered. As well as I could tell, it appeared to be
a female and quite grown.</p>

<p>I may take occasion to remark that while the
chimpanzee is mostly found in large family groups,
as I have reason to believe from native accounts of
them, and from what has been told me by white men,
I have never been able to see a family of them
together, but each of these that I have mentioned, so
far as I could tell, was quite alone. Whether the
others were scattered through the forest in like
manner, hunting for food, and all came together after
this or not, I can only say that every chimpanzee
that I saw was alone at the time.</p>

<p>Another thing worthy of mention is the fact that
both these apes live in the same forest, and twice on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the same day I have seen both kinds. This is contrary
to the common idea that they do not inhabit
the same jungle. It appears that where there is a
great number of the one there are but few of the
other. The natives say that in combat between the
chimpanzee and gorilla, the former is always victor,
on which account the latter is afraid of him. I
believe this to be true, because the chimpanzee,
although not so strong, is more active and more
intelligent than the gorilla.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee will not approach or attack man
if he can avoid it, but he does not shrink from him
as the gorilla does. One instance that will illustrate
this phase of his character I shall relate. On one
occasion recently, while I was on the coast, a native
boy started across a small plain near the trading
station. Along with him was a dog that belonged
to the white trader at the place. The dog was in
advance of the boy, and as the latter emerged from
a small clump of the bush he heard the dog bark in a
playful manner, and discovered him not more than
thirty yards away, prancing, jumping, and barking in
a jolly way with a chimpanzee which appeared to be
five or six years old. The ape was standing in the
path along which the boy was proceeding. He was
slapping at the dog with his hands, and did not
seem to relish the sport, yet he was not resenting it
in anger. The dog thought the ape was playing
with him, and he was taking the whole thing in fun.
The boy looked at them for a few moments and
retreated. As soon as he disappeared the dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
desisted and followed him to the house. The boy
was afraid of the ape, and made no attempt to capture
him. The latter was taken by surprise by the
dog and boy, and thus had no time to escape. He
did not strike to harm the dog, but only to ward him
off. The dog made no attempt to bite him, but
when he would jump up against him he would
knock the ape out of balance, and this annoyed
him. He didn't seem to understand just what the
dog meant.</p>

<p>I shall not describe those so well known in captivity,
only to mention some of them. The largest
specimen of the chimpanzee that I have ever seen
was Chico, who belonged to Mr. James A. Bailey, of
New York. He was as large perhaps as these apes
ever become, although he was less than ten years
old when he died.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most valuable specimen for scientific
use that has ever been in captivity is Johanna, who
belongs to the same gentleman. The history that
is given of her, however, is hardly to be taken in
full faith. Her age cannot be determined with
certainty, but it is said that she is about thirteen
years old. I have reason to doubt that, although I
cannot positively deny it. Whatever may be her
exact age, it is certain that she has now reached a
complete adult state. She has grown to be quite as
large as Chico was at the time of his death. She is
not of amiable temper, but is much less vicious than
he was. She has some of the marks of a kulu
kamba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
In order to justify my doubts upon the subject of
her age, I may state that Chico was only ten years
of age when he died, but had reached the adult
period; and as males do not reach that state sooner
than the females of any genus of the primates, it is
not probable that he was mature at ten, while she
was not so until twelve. In the next place, her
captors claim to have seen her within a few hours
after her birth, and that they watched her and her
mother from time to time until she was one year old,
when they killed the mother and captured the babe.
The claim is absurd. These apes are nomadic in
habit, and are rarely ever seen in the same place.
They claim that she was born on January 19, but from
what I know of these apes that is not their season of
bearing, and I doubt if any of them were ever born
during that month. Again, it is claimed that she
was captured by Portuguese explorers in the Congo,
but the Portuguese do not possess any territory
along that river in which these apes are ever found.
They claim the territory around Kabenda, which
would indicate that she came from the Loango
Valley instead of the Congo, but the cupidity of the
average Portuguese would never allow anything to
go at liberty for a year if it could be sold before that
time.</p>

<p>Johanna is accredited with a great deal of intelligence;
but I do not regard her as being above the
average of her race. Since the death of her companion,
Chico, she has received the sole attention of
her keeper, and since that time has been taught a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
few things which are neither marvellous nor difficult.
In point of intellect she cannot be regarded as an
extraordinary specimen of her tribe. I do not mean
to detract from her reputation, but I have failed to
discover in her any high order of mental qualities.</p>

<p>The reason why Johanna may be regarded as the
most valuable specimen for study is the fact that she
is the only female of her race that has ever reached
the state of puberty. She has done so, and this
fact enables us to determine certain things which
have never heretofore been known. This affords
the Zoologists an opportunity for the study of her
sexual development which may not again present
itself in many years to come. From this important
point of view she presents the student with many
new problems in that branch of science.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere stated as my opinion that the
female chimpanzee reaches the age of puberty at
seven to nine years, and I have many reasons which
I will not here recount, that cause me to adhere to
that belief. But the uncertainty of the age of this
ape does not destroy her value as a subject of scientific
study.</p>

<p>The most sagacious specimen of the race that I
have been brought in contact with is Consul II.,
who is now an inmate of the Bellvue Garden of
Manchester, England. He has not been educated
to perform mere tricks to gratify the visitor in the
way that animals are usually trained, but most of
the feats that he performs are prompted by his own
desire and for his own pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;"><img id="i_165" src="images/i_165.jpg" width="430" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">CONSUL II. RIDING A TRICYCLE</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
There is a vast difference in the motives that
prompt animals in the execution of these feats. I
have elsewhere mentioned the fact that animals that
are caused to act from fear do so mechanically, and it
is not a true index to their intellect. While Consul
and a few other apes that I have seen do many
things by imitation they do not do so from coercion.
They seem to understand the purpose and foresee
the results, and these impel them to act.</p>

<p>Some of the feats performed by this ape I have
never seen attempted by any other. One accomplishment
is riding a tricycle. He knows the
machine by the name of "bike," although it is not
really a bicycle. He can adjust it and mount it with
the skill of an acrobat. The ease and grace with
which he rides are sufficient to provoke the envy of
any boy in England. He propels it with great skill
and steers it with the accuracy of an expert. He
guides it around angles and obstacles in the way
with absolute precision.</p>

<p>Consul is allowed to go at liberty a great deal of
his time, which is the proper way to treat these apes
in captivity. He rides the wheel for his own diversion.
He does not do it to gratify strangers or to
"show off."</p>

<p>Another accomplishment which he has, is that of
smoking a pipe, cigar, or cigarette. It may not be
commended from a moral standpoint, but the act
appears to afford him quite as much pleasure as it
does the average boy when he first acquires it, and
he has also formed the habit of spitting as he smokes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
but he has the good manners not to spit on the
floor. When Consul has his pipe lighted he usually
sits on the floor to enjoy it, and he spreads a sheet
of paper down before him to spit on. When he has
finished smoking he rolls up the paper and throws it
into some corner out of the way. When playing
about the grounds he often finds a cigar stub. He
knows what it is, picks it up, puts it into his mouth
and at once goes to his keeper for a light. He will
not attempt to light his pipe or cigar, because he is
afraid of burning his fingers; but he will light a
match and hand it to his keeper to hold while lighting
the pipe. He sometimes takes a piece of paper,
lights it in the fire and hands it to some one else to
light his pipe for him. He is afraid of the fire, and
will not hold the paper while it is burning. If any
one hesitates to take it from him, he throws it at
them and gets out of the way. He is not so fond of
cigarettes, because he gets the tobacco in his mouth,
and he does not like the taste of it.</p>

<p>When Consul is furnished with a piece of chalk,
he begins to draw some huge figure on the wall or
floor. He never attempts to make a small design
with chalk, but if given a pencil and paper he
executes some peculiar figure of smaller design.
Those made with the chalk or pencil are usually
round or oval in shape, but if given a pen and ink he
at once begins to make a series of small figures containing
many acute angles. Whether these results
are from design or accident I cannot say, but he
appears to have a well-defined idea as to the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the instrument, but whether he can distinguish
between writing and drawing I am unable to say.</p>

<p>The only abstract thing that his keeper has tried
to teach him is to select the letters of the alphabet.
He has learned to distinguish the first three. These
are made upon the faces of cubical blocks of wood:
each block contains one letter on each of its faces.
He selects the letter asked for with very few mistakes,
and this appears to be from indifference more
than from ignorance.</p>

<p>Consul is very fond of play, and makes friends
with some strangers on sight, but to others he takes
an aversion without any apparent cause, and while
he is not disposed to be vicious when not annoyed,
he resents with anger the approaches of certain
persons. He is the only one I have seen that can
use a knife and fork with very much skill, but he
cuts up his food with almost as much ease as a boy
of the same age would do, and uses his fork in
eating. He has been taught to do this until he
rarely uses his fingers in the act. He is fond of
coffee and beer, but does not care for spirits.</p>

<p>There is nothing that so much delights Consul as
to get into the large cage of monkeys and baboons
kept in the garden. Most of them are afraid of him.
But one large Guinea baboon is not, and on every
occasion he shows his dislike for the ape. The
latter, however, takes many chances in teasing him,
but always manages to evade his attack. He displays
much skill and a great degree of caution in
playing these pranks upon the baboon when at close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
range. Upon the approach of the ape the other
animals in the cage all seek some refuge, and he
finds great diversion in stealing up to their place of
concealment to frighten them. Consul is very strong,
and can lift objects of surprising weight. It is
awkward for him to stand in an upright position, but
he does so with more ease than any other chimpanzee
that I have ever seen. If any one will take hold of
his hand he will stroll with him for a long time without
apparent fatigue.</p>

<p>Owing to the sudden changes of temperature in
that part of England, he is provided with a coat,
which he is often required to wear when going out
of doors. He does not like to be hampered with
such garments, and if for a moment he is not
watched, he removes it, and sometimes hides it to
keep from wearing it. He is also provided with
trousers, which he dislikes more if possible than his
coat; but above all other articles of wearing apparel
he dislikes shoes. His keeper often puts them on
him, but whenever he gets out of sight he unties
and removes them. He cannot tie the laces, but
can untie them in an instant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;"><img id="i_171" src="images/i_171.jpg" width="424" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">CONSUL II. IN FULL DRESS</div></div>

<p>He does not evince so much aversion to a hat or
cap, and will sometimes put one on without being
told; but he has a perfect mania for a silk hat, and
if allowed to do so he would demolish that of every
stranger who comes to the garden. He has a decided
vein of humour and a love of approbation.
When he does anything that is funny or clever, he
is perfectly aware of the fact; and when by any act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
he evokes a laugh from any one he is happy, and
recognises the approval by a broad chimpanzee grin.</p>

<p>In the corner of the monkey-house is a room set
apart for the keeper, and in this room supplies of
food for the inmates are kept. In a small cupboard
in one corner is kept a supply of bananas and other
fruits. Consul knows this and has tried many times
to burglarise it. On one occasion he secured a large
screw-driver and attempted to prise open the door.
He found the resistance to be greatest at the place
where the door locked, and at this point he forced
the instrument in the crevice and broke off a piece
of the wood about an inch wide from the edge of the
door. At this juncture he was discovered and
reproved for his conduct, but he never fails to stick
his fingers in this crack and try to open the door.
He has not been able to unlock it when the key is
given him, although he knows the use of it, and has
often tried, but his keeper has never imparted the
secret to him, and his method of using the key has
been to prise with it, or pull it instead of turning it
after putting it in the keyhole.</p>

<p>The young keeper, Mr. Webb, deserves great
credit for his untiring attention to this valuable
young ape, and the results of his zeal are worthy of
the recognition of every man who is interested in
the study of animals.</p>

<p>Another specimen that may be regarded as an
intermediate type was recently kept in Belle Vue
Gardens at Manchester. He was playful and full
of mischief. He had been taught to use a stick or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
broom to fight with, and with such a weapon in his
hand would run all over the building, hunting some
one to fight. He did not appear to be serious in
his assault, but treated it as fun. It was a bad thing
to teach an ape, because they grow pugnacious as
they grow older, and all animals kept closely confined
acquire a bad temper.</p>

<p>In an adjoining cage was kept a young orang,
and the two ate at the same table. The chimpanzee
appeared to entertain a species of contempt for the
orang. The keeper had taught him to pass the
bread to his neighbour, and he obeyed this with
such reluctance that his manner betrayed more disgust
than kindness. A few small pieces of bread
were placed on a tin plate, and the kulu was required
to lift the plate in his hand, and offer it to
the orang before he himself was allowed to eat.
He would lift the plate a few inches above the table,
and hold it before the orang's face; when the latter
had taken a piece of the bread, the chimpanzee withdrew
the plate, held it for a moment, and dropped
it. Meanwhile he kept his eyes fixed on the orang.
The manner in which he dropped the plate looked
as if he did so in contempt. When the meal was
finished, the kulu would drink his milk from a cup,
wipe his mouth with the serviette, and then get
down from the table. The orang would slowly
climb down, and go back to his cage. We shall
not describe the details of their home-life, but they
were two jolly young bachelors, one of which was
as stupid as the other was bright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
The specimens that were kept in the Gardens in
New York were very fine. One of them was
mentally equal to any other specimen hitherto in
captivity. There were two kept in the Cincinnati
Gardens which were also very fine. There have
never been but nine of these apes brought to
America so far as I am aware, but six of these lived
longer and four of them grew to be larger than any
other specimens of this race have ever done in captivity.
For some reason they never survive long in
England, or other parts of Europe. This is probably
due to some condition of the atmosphere. It
cannot be from a difference of treatment.</p>

<p>I have seen a large number of chimpanzees, but
most of them were in captivity, yet I have seen
enough of them in a wild state to gain some idea of
their habits and manner, but those described will
be sufficient to show the mental character of the
genus.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />

<span class="subhead">OTHER KULU-KAMBAS</span></h2>

<p>Whether the kulu-kamba is a distinct species of
ape, or only a well-marked variety of the chimpanzee,
he is by far the finest representative of his
genus. Among those that I have seen are some
very good specimens, and the clever things that I
have witnessed them do are sufficient to stamp
them as the highest type of all apes.</p>

<p>On board a small river steamer that plies the
Ogowe, was a young female kulu that belonged to
the captain. Her face was not by any means
handsome, and her complexion was the darkest of
any kulu I have ever seen. It was almost a coffee-colour.
There were two or three spots much
darker in shade, but not well defined in outline.
The dark spots looked as if they had been artificially
put on the face. The colour was not solid, but
looked as if dry burnt umber had been rubbed or
sprinkled over a surface of lighter brown. Although
she was young (perhaps not more than two years old),
her face looked almost like that of a woman of forty.
Her short, flat nose, big, flexible lips, protruding
jaws and prominent arches over the eyes, with a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
receding forehead, conspired to make her look like a
certain type of human being one frequently sees.
This gave her what is known as a dish-face, or a
concave profile. She had a habit of compressing
her nose by contracting the muscles of the face;
curling her lips as if in scorn, and at the same time
glancing at those around her as if to express the
most profound contempt.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the sentiment in her
mind, her face was a picture of disdain, and the
circumstances under which she made use of these
grimaces, certainly pointed to the fact that she felt
just like she looked. At other times her visage
would be covered with a perfect smile. It was
something more than a grin, and the fact that it was
used only at a time when she was pleased or diverted,
showed that the emotion which gave rise to it was
perfectly in keeping with the face itself. In repose
her face was neither pretty nor ugly. It did not
strongly depict a high mental status, nor yet portray
the instincts of a brute; but her countenance was as
safe an index to the mind as that of the human
being. This is true of the chimpanzee more perhaps
than of any other ape. The gorilla doubtless feels
the sense of pleasure, but his face does not yield to
the emotion, while the opposite passions are expressed
with great intensity, and with the common
chimpanzee it is the same way, but not to the same
extent.</p>

<p>The kulu in question was more of a coquette than
she was of a shrew. She plainly showed that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
was fond of flattery. Not perhaps in the same sense
that a human being is, but she was certainly conscious
of approbation and fond of applause. When
she accomplished anything difficult, she seemed
aware of it; and when she succeeded in doing a thing
which she was not allowed to do, she never failed to
express herself in the manner described above. She
always appeared to be perfectly conscious of being
observed by others, but she was defiant and composed.
There was nothing known in the catalogue
of mischief that she was not ready to tackle at any
moment and take her chances on the result. From
the stoke-hole to the funnel, from the jack-staff to
the rudder, she explored that boat.</p>

<p>To keep her out of mischief, she was tied on the
saloon deck with a long line, but no one aboard the
vessel was able to tie a knot in the line which she
could not untie with dexterity and ease. Her
master, who was a sailor and an expert in the art of
tying knots, exhausted his efforts in trying to make
one that would defy her skill.</p>

<p>On one occasion I was aboard the little steamer
when the culprit was brought up from the main deck
where she had been in some mischief, and tied to
one of the rails along the side of the boat. The
question of tying her was discussed, and at length a
new plan was devised. In the act of untying a knot
she always began with the part of the knot that was
nearest to her. It was now agreed to tie the line
around one of the rails on the side of the deck, about
half-way between the two stanchions that supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
it, then to carry the loose ends of the line to the
stanchion and make it fast in the angle of it and the
rail. This was done. As soon as she was left alone
she began to examine the knots; but she made no
attempt at first to untie them except to feel them as
if to see how firmly they were made. She then
climbed up on the iron rail around which the middle
of the line was tied, and slackened the knot. She
pulled first at one strand and then at the other, but
one end was tied to the stanchion and the other to
her neck, and she could find no loose end to draw
through. First one way and then the other she
drew this noose. She saw that in some way it was
connected with the stanchion. She drew the noose
along the rail until it was near the post; she climbed
down upon the deck, then around the post and back
again; she climbed up over the rails and down on
the outside, and again carefully examined the knot;
she climbed back, then through between the rails
and back, then under the rails and back, but she
could find no way to get this first knot out of the
line. For a moment she sat down on the deck, and
viewed the situation with evident concern. She
slowly rose to her feet and again examined it; she
moved the noose back to its place in the middle of
the rail, climbed up by it, and again drew it out as far
as the strands would allow. Again she closed it; she
took one strand in her hand and traced it from the
loop to the stanchion, then she took the other end
in the same manner and traced it from the loop to
her neck. She looked at the loop and then slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
drew it out as far as it would come. She sat for a
while holding it in one hand, and with the other
moved each strand of the knot. She was in a deep
study, and did not even deign a glance at those who
were watching her. At length she took the loop in
both hands, deliberately put it over her head and
crawled through it. The line thus released dropped
to the deck; she quickly descended, took hold of it
near her neck, and found that it was untied; she
gathered it up as she advanced towards the other
end that was tied to the post, and at once began to
loosen the knots about it. In a minute more the
last knot was released, when she gathered the whole
line into a bundle, looked at those around her with
that look of contempt which we have described, and
departed at once in search of other mischief. The
air of triumph and contempt was enough to convince
any one of her opinion of what she had done.</p>

<p>If this feat was the result of instinct, the lexicons
must find another definition for that word. There
were six white men who witnessed the act, and the
verdict of all was that she had solved a problem
which few children of her own age could have done.
Every movement was controlled by reason. The
tracing out of cause and effect was too evident for
any one to doubt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_181" src="images/i_181.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">NATIVE VILLAGE AT GLASS GABOON</div></div>

<p>Almost any animal can be taught to perform
certain feats, but that does not show the innate
capacity. The only true measure of the faculty of
reason is to reduce the actor to his own resources,
and see how he will render himself under some new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
condition, otherwise the act will be, at least in part,
mechanical or imitative. In all my efforts to study
the mental calibre of animals I have confined them
strictly to their own judgment, and left them to work
out the problem alone. By this means only can we
estimate to what extent they apply the faculty of
reason. No one doubts that all animals have minds,
which are receptive in some degree. But it has
often been said that they are devoid of reason, and
controlled alone by some vague attribute called
instinct. Such is not the case. It is the same
faculty of the mind that men employ to solve the
problems that arise in every sphere of life. It is the
one which sages and philosophers have used in
every phase of science. It differs in degree, but not
in kind.</p>

<p>This kulu-kamba knew the use of a corkscrew.
This she had acquired from seeing it applied by men.
While she could not use it herself with success, she
often tried and never applied it to the wrong purpose.</p>

<p>She would take the deck broom and scrub the
deck, unless there was water on it, in which event
she always left the job. She did not seem to know
the purpose of sweeping the deck, and never swept
the dirt before the broom. This was doubtless
imitative. She only grasped the idea that a broom
was used to scrub the deck, but she failed to observe
the effect produced. However, it cannot be said
with certainty to what extent she was aware of the
effect, but it is inferred from the fact that she did
not try to remove the dirt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
She knew what coal was intended for, and often
climbed into the bunker and threw it down by the
furnace door. The furnace door and steam gauge
were two things that escaped her busy fingers. I
do not know how she learned the danger of them,
but she never touched them. She had to be
watched to keep her from seizing the machinery.
For this she seemed to have a strong desire, but did
not know the danger she incurred.</p>

<p>I was aboard a ship when a trader brought off
from the beach a young kulu to be sent to England.
The little captive sat upright on the deck and
seemed aware that he was being sent away. At
any rate his face wore a look of deep concern as if
he had no friend to whom he could appeal. On
approaching him I spoke to him, using his own word
for food. He looked up and promptly answered it.
He looked as if in doubt as to whether I was a big
ape or something else. I repeated the sound, and
he repeated the answer and came towards me. As
he approached me I again gave the sound. He
came up and sat by my feet for a moment, looking
into my face. I uttered the sound again, when he
took hold of my leg and began to climb up as if it
had been a tree. He climbed up to my neck and
began to play with my lips, nose and ears. We at
once became friends, and I tried to buy him, but the
price asked was more than I desired to pay. I
regretted to part with him, but he was taken back to
the beach, and I never saw him again.</p>

<p>On another occasion one was brought aboard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
after speaking to him I gave him an orange; he
began to eat it and at the same time caught hold of
the leg of my trousers as if he did not wish me to
leave him. I petted and caressed him for a moment
and turned away, but he held on to me. He
waddled about over the deck, holding on to my
clothes, and would not release me. He was afraid
of his master and the native boy who had him in
charge. He was a timid creature, but was quite
intelligent, and I felt sorry for him because he
seemed to realise his situation.</p>

<p>On the same voyage I saw one in the hands of a
German trader. It was a young male, about one
year old. He promptly answered the food sound,
and I called him to come to me; but this he neither
answered nor complied with. He looked at me as if
to ask where I had learned his language. I repeated
the sound several times, but elicited no answer. I
have elsewhere called attention to the fact that these
apes do not answer the call when they can see the
one who makes it, and they do not always comply
with it. In this respect they behave very much the
same as young children, and it may be remarked
that one difficulty in all apes is to secure fixed
attention. This is exactly the same with young
children. Even when they clearly understand, sometimes
they betray no sign of having heard it. At
other times they show that they both hear and
understand, but do not comply.</p>

<p>Another specimen that was brought aboard a ship
when I was present was a young male, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
less than two years old. He was sullen and morose.
He did not resent my approaches, but he did not
encourage them. I first spoke to him with the food
sound, but he gave no heed. I retired a little
distance from him and called him, but he paid no
attention. I then used the sound of warning; he
raised his head, and looked in the direction from
which the sound came. I repeated it, and he looked
at me for a moment and turned his head away. I
repeated it again. He looked at me, then looked
around as if to see what it meant, and again resumed
his attitude of repose.</p>

<p>On my last voyage to the coast I saw a very good
specimen in the Congo. It was a female, a little
more than two years old. She was also of a dark
complexion, but quite intelligent. She had been
captured north of there, and within the limits elsewhere
described. At the time I saw her she was ill
and under treatment, but her master, the British
consul, told me that when she was well she was
bright and sociable. I made no attempt to talk with
her, except some time after, having left her, I gave
the call sound, which she answered by looking around
the corner of the house. I do not know whether she
would have come or not, as she was tied and could
not have done so had she desired to.</p>

<p>I have seen a few other specimens of this ape,
and most of them appear to be of a somewhat higher
order than the ordinary chimpanzee, but there is
among them a wide range of intelligence. It would
be a risk to say whether the lowest specimen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
kulu is higher or lower than the highest specimen of
the common chimpanzee or not, but taken as a
whole they are much superior. I shall not describe
at length the specimens which have been known in
captivity, since most of them have been amply described
by others; but it is not out of place to
mention some of them.</p>

<p>If proper conditions were afforded to keep a pair
of kulus in training for some years, it is difficult to
say what they might not be taught. They are not
only apt in learning what they are taught, but they
are well-disposed, and can apply their accomplishment
to some useful end. We cannot say to what
extent they may be able to apply what they learn
from man, because the necessity of doing so is
removed by the attention given them.</p>

<p>In the order of nature the gorilla occupies the
second place below man. His habitat is in the lowlands
of West Tropical Africa, and is confined to
very narrow limits. The vague line which bounds
his realm cannot be defined with absolute precision,
but those generally given in books that treat of him
are not correct. If he ever occupied any part of
the coast north of the equator, he has long since
become extinct in that part, but there is nothing to
show that he ever did exist there. So far as I have
been able to trace the lines that prescribe his native
haunts, he appears to be confined to the low, delta
country, lying between the Equator and Loango
along the coast, and reaching eastward to the
interior, an average distance of about one hundred
miles. The eastern boundary is very irregular. To
be more exact, the extreme limit on the north side
would be the Gaboon River to its head-waters,
thence southward to the Ogowe River to the mouth
of the Nguni River; up that river twenty or thirty
miles, thence a zigzag line along the western base
of the dividing lands between the Congo basin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
the Atlantic watershed, to the head-waters of the
Chi Loango River, and with that to the coast.
Beyond these lines I have never been able to find
any trace of him, and along this boundary only now
and then are they found. I have seen two adult
and two infant skulls of the gorilla that were
brought by Mr. Wm. S. Cherry, from the Kisango
Valley, which lies north of the middle Congo in the
interior. The skulls are the only evidence I have
ever found of this ape existing so far eastward, but
they were said to have come from that part of the
valley lying directly under the equator. Mr. Cherry
did not collect them himself, but secured them from
natives, and does not claim to have seen any of these
apes alive.</p>

<p>There appear to be three centres of population:
the first is in the basin of Izanga Lake; the second
in the basin of Lake Fernan Vaz; and the third in
the basin of the lake behind Sette Kama. They
are rarely ever found in high or hilly districts, but
appear to inhabit the hummock lands, which are
only elevated a few feet above tide-level. This is
singular, from the fact that the ape has a morbid
dislike for deep water, and I think it doubtful if he
can swim, although he has one peculiar character
that belongs to aquatic animals, which is a kind of
web between the digits, but its purpose cannot be to
aid in swimming. I have been told that the gorilla
can swim, and it may be true; but I have never
observed anything in his habits to confirm this,
while I have noted many facts that controvert it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
I know of no valid reason why he should be confined
so strictly within the limits mentioned, unless
it be from a condition of climate which seems
peculiar to this district. South of it the climate
along the coast is much cooler, and the country back
of it is hilly and barren; north of the Equator is a
land of perpetual rain, while to the eastward, it is
mountainous. Within this district the rainy and dry
seasons are more fixed and uniform.</p>

<p>The gorilla appears to be an indigenous product
which does not bear transplanting; he thrives only
in a low, hot and humid region, infested by malaria,
miasma and fevers. It is doubtful if he can long
survive in a pure atmosphere.</p>

<p>The only single specimen that I have ever heard
of north of the equator, was one on the south side
of the Komo River, which is the north branch of the
Gaboon. The point at which I heard of him was
within a few miles of the equator. I also heard of
five having been seen a few miles south-west from
Njole, which is located on the Equator on the south
side of the Ogowe, a little way east of the Nguni,
and they were said to be the first ever seen in that
part within the memory of man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_191" src="images/i_191.jpg" width="600" height="457" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">NATIVES SKINNING A GORILLA</div></div>

<p>As to their being found between Gaboon and
Cameroon, I can find no trace along the coast of one
ever having been seen in that part. Certain writers
have mentioned the fact that in 1851 and 1852 they
came in great numbers from the interior to the coast.
From such a statement it might be inferred that
they were seen in herds or armies together, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the truth was that in those years a few more gorillas
appeared to be in the jungle than was usual, but
they were not north of the Gaboon River. They
were in the Ogowe delta about 1° south latitude;
but no one ever supposed that they came from the
Crystal Mountains or any other mountains. At that
time neither traders nor missionaries had ascended
the Gaboon River above Parrot Island (which is less
than twenty miles from the mouth), except to make
a flying trip by canoe, and nothing was known of
that part except what was learned from the natives,
and that was very little. During my first voyage I
went up that river as far as Nenge Nenge, about
seventy-five miles from the coast. I spent two days
there with a white trader who had been stationed
there for a year, and I was assured by him that there
were no gorillas known in that part. The natives
report that they have been found in the lowlands
south of there in the direction of the Ogowe basin;
but their reports are conflicting, and none of them, so
far as I could learn, claim that he is found north of
there, nor in the mountains eastward. I admit the
possibility that he has been found and may yet
inhabit the strip of land between this river and the
Ogowe, but I repeat that there is no proof that he
was ever found north of the Gaboon. With due
respect to Sir Richard Owen and others who have
never been in that country, I insist that they are
mistaken.</p>

<p>It is true that one of the tribes living north of the
Gaboon has a name for this animal, but it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
follow that he lives in that country. The Orunga
tribe have a name for lion, but there is not such a
beast within 400 miles of their country, and not one
of that tribe ever saw one.</p>

<p>A vast number of specimens have been secured at
Gaboon, but they have been brought there from far
away, because it is the chief town of the colony, and
there are more white men there to buy them than
elsewhere. It is quite impossible for a stranger to
ascertain what part a specimen is brought from.
The native hunter will not tell the truth lest some one
else should find the game and thus deprive him of
its capture and sale.</p>

<p>I once saw a specimen at Cameroon, and was
told that it had been captured in that valley fifty
miles from the coast; but I hunted up its history and
found with absolute certainty that it was captured
near Mayumba, 200 miles south of Gaboon. Even
with the greatest care in hunting up the history of
specimens one may fail, and often does in tracing
it to its true source, but every one so far, that I
have followed up, has been brought somewhere
within the limits I have laid down. Contrary to the
statement of some authorities that these apes "have
never been seen on the coast" since 1852, the greatest
number of them are found near the coast. I do
not mean to say that they sit on the sand along the
beach, or bathe in the surf, but they live in the jungle
of that part.</p>

<p>Along the Lower Congo the gorilla is known only
in name, and scores of the natives do not know even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
that. The nearest point to that river that I have
been able to locate the gorilla as a native, is in the
territory about sixty or seventy miles north-west of
Stanley Pool.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the late Carl Steckelmann, who
was drowned at Mayumba in my presence last
October. He was an old resident of the coast, a
good explorer, a careful observer, and an extensive
traveller. I knew him well, and secured from him
much information concerning the gorilla. He traced
out with me, on a map, what he believed to be the
south and south-east limits of the gorilla. Not thirty
minutes before the fatal accident in which he lost his
life, I had closed arrangements with him to make an
expedition from Mayumba to the Congo, near Stanley
Pool, by one route, and return by another, but his
death prevented its fulfilment.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson, who was the first missionary at Gaboon
and located there in 1842, wrote a lexicon of the
native language about six years after that time. In
this he entirely omits the name of the gorilla. Dr.
Walker eight years later gave the definition, "a
monkey larger than a man." But he had never
seen a specimen of the ape, except the skulls and
a skeleton which were brought from other parts.
It is true that Dr. Savage first learned at Gaboon
about the gorilla, and secured a skull at that place
from which he made drawings, and on which account
his name was attached to the animal in Natural
History. Dr. Ford a few years later sent the first
skeleton to America, and Captain Harris sent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
first to England. The former is in the Museum of
Zoology at Philadelphia. Both of these specimens
may have come from any place a hundred miles away
from Gaboon.</p>

<p>It is possible at this early date the gorilla may
have occupied the peninsula south of the Gaboon
River, in greater numbers than he has ever done
since, because up to that time there had been no
demand for him; but if such was true at that time, it
is not so now, and if he is not extinct in that part,
he is so rare as to make it doubtful whether or not
he is found there at all.</p>

<p>In four journeys along the Ogowe River and the
lakes of that valley, I made careful inquiries at many
of the towns, and the natives assured me that the
gorillas lived on the south side of that river. I spent
five days at the village of Mbiro, which is located on
the north side of the river and about fifty miles from
the coast. There I was told by the native woodsmen
that no gorillas lived on the north side, but
there were plenty of them along the lakes south of
the river. They said that in the forest back of that
town were plenty of chimpanzees, and that they were
sometimes mistaken for gorillas, but there were
absolutely none of the latter in that part. In view
of these and countless other facts, I deem it safe to
say that few or no gorillas can be found north of the
Ogowe River at any point, and I even doubt if the
specimen heard of on the Komo was a genuine
gorilla. The natives sometimes claim to have something
of the kind for sale in order to get a bonus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
from some trader, when in truth he may not have
anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The only point north of the Ogowe at which I
had any reason to believe a gorilla could be found
was in the neighbourhood of a small lake called
Inenga. This lake is nearly due west from the
mouth of the Nguni River and something more than
a hundred miles from the coast. Certain reports along
that part appeared to have some flavour of truth, but
there was no proof except the word of the natives.</p>

<p>In the lake region south of the river they are
fairly abundant as far south as the head-waters of the
Rembo Nkami and through the low country of the
Esyira tribe, but they are very rare in the forests,
and unknown in the highlands and plains of this
country. South of the Chi Loango they are quite
unknown, and south of the Congo never heard of.</p>

<p>There are no means possible to estimate their
number, but they are not so numerous as may be
supposed, and from the reckless slaughter of them
by the natives in order to secure them for white men,
they may soon become extinct. Their ferocity alone
has saved them up to this time from such a fate, but
the use of approved arms will soon overcome that.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the gorilla is so nearly the same
as that of the chimpanzee, which has elsewhere been
compared to the human skeleton, that we shall not
review the comparison at length, but must note one
marked feature in the external form of the skull,
which differs alike from other apes and man.</p>

<p>The skull of the young gorilla is much like that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the chimpanzee, and remains so until he approaches
the adult state; but as he approaches this period,
the ridge above the eyes becomes more prominent,
and at the same time a sharp, bony ridge begins to
develop along the temples, and continues around the
back of the head on that part of the skull called the
occiput. At this point it is intersected by another
ridge at right angles to it. This is called the sagittal
ridge, and runs along the top of the head towards
the face; but on the forehead it flattens nearly to
the level of the skull, and divides into two very low
ridges, which turn off to a point above the eyes and
merges into that ridge. These appear to be a continuous
part of the skull, and are not joined to it by
sutures. The mesial crest in very old specimens
rises to the height of nearly two inches above the
surface of the skull, and imparts to it a fierce and
savage aspect; but in the living animal the crests
are not seen, as the depressions between them are
filled with large muscles, which make the head look
very much larger than it would otherwise. These
crests affect only the exterior of the skull, and do not
appear to alter the form or size of the brain cavity,
which is larger in proportion than that of the chimpanzee.
These crests are peculiar to the male gorilla,
and the female skull shows no trace of them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_199" src="images/i_199.jpg" width="600" height="408" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PLATE I</div></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img id="i_202" src="images/i_202.jpg" width="600" height="398" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PLATE II</div></div>

<p>There is at least one case in which this crest has
failed to develop in the male. By reference to the
series of skulls found in the cuts given herewith,
No. 6 is that of an adult male, which I know to be
such, as I dissected him and prepared the skeleton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
myself. He was killed in the basin of Lake Fernan
Vaz, not more than two or three hours from my
cage, and his body was brought to me at once. A
good idea of his size can be obtained by reference
to another cut given herewith, where I have some
natives skinning him. In this picture he is sitting
flat on the sand; his body is limp, and is somewhat
shorter than it was in life, and yet it can be seen
that the top of his head is higher than the hip of the
man who is holding him. On the left of the gorilla,
in the foreground, sits the man who killed him. He
is sitting on a log, and it did not occur to me until
too late to place them side by side in order to make
a comparison. The body and head of this gorilla as
he sits measured nearly four feet from the base of
the spinal column to the top of the head. I did not
weigh him, but made an estimate by lifting him in
my hand, and believed he weighed at least 240 lbs.
Yet he was not an old specimen, but if compared to
No. 7, in which the crests are well developed, it is
found to be larger, and other things point to the fact
that he was older.</p>

<p>I am aware that one specimen of itself does not
prove anything, but it shows in this case that this
ape does not always develop that crest. His head
was surmounted by the red crown which we have
described, and No. 1, which is the skull of Othello,
had the same mark. He was captured near the
place where No. 6 was killed. No. 2, which is the
skull of a young female nearly four years old, had the
same, and she was also captured in the same basin,
but on the opposite side of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
The facial bones of No. 6 showed that the animal
had received a severe blow in early life, but the
fragments had knitted together, and the effect could
not be seen in the face of the ape while alive. In
this same picture it will be noticed that the lower lip
hangs down so low that the mouth is opened. The
lip is very massive and mobile, and in this character
he resembles the negro. The lower lip is much
thicker and more flexible than the upper.</p>

<p>No. 8 is the skull of a large male from Lake
Izanga, which is on the south side of the Ogowe
River, more than a hundred miles from the coast,
and is one of the three centres of population mentioned.
I do not know its history. It was presented
to me by Mr. James Deemin, an English trader with
whom I travelled many days in the Ogowe River;
and I wish here to take occasion to express my
sincere thanks to him for the many kindnesses
extended to me.</p>

<p>No. 5 is the skull of an adult female. By comparing
it in profile to No. 6 it will be seen that they
resemble, but the muzzle of the latter projects a
little more, and the curvature of the skull across the
top is less: the distance a little greater.</p>

<p>Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 are female; the others are all
male.</p>

<p>Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10 belong to the Liverpool
Museum, but are shown here for comparison. The
other four are all at Toronto University.</p>

<p>While this series is not complete in either sex, it is
an excellent one for comparative study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
I do not know whether the heads of those with
the crests were the same colour as No. 6 or not, but
the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">ntyii</i>, which I have mentioned as possibly a new
species of the gorilla, does not have this crown of
red. His ears are also said to be larger than those
of the gorilla, but smaller than the chimpanzee's,
and he is reputed to grow to a larger size than either
of them.</p>

<p>The skin of the gorilla is a dull black or mummy
colour over the body, but that of the face is a jet
black, quite smooth and soft. It looks almost like
velvet.</p>

<p>One fact peculiar to this ape is, that the palms of
both hands and feet are perfectly black. In other
animals these are usually lighter in colour than the
exposed parts. In all races of men, in all other
apes, monkeys, baboons, and lemurs, the palms are
lighter than the backs of the hands, and the same
is true of the feet. The thumb of the gorilla is
more perfect than that of the chimpanzee, yet it is
smaller in proportion to the hand than in man.
The hand is very large, but has more the shape of
the hand of a woman than that of man. The
fingers taper in a graceful manner, but appear much
shorter, by reason of the web alluded to, than they
really are. It is not really a web, in the true sense,
but the integument between the fingers is extended
down almost to the second joint, but the forward
edge of the web, when the fingers are spread, is
concave; when brought together, the skin on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
knuckles becomes wrinkled, and the web almost disappears.
This effect is more readily noticed in the
living animal than in the dead. The texture of the
skin in the palms is coarsely granulated, and the
palmar lines are indistinct. The great toe sets at
an angle from the side of the foot, like a thumb, but
has more prehensile power than that of the hand;
but the foot is much less flexible, and has less prehensile
power.</p>

<p>At this point I desire to draw attention to one
important fact. The tendons of the foot, which
open and close the digits, are imbedded in the palm
in a deep layer of coarse, gristly matter, which
forms a pad, as it were, under the sole of the foot,
and prevents it from bending; therefore it is not
possible for the gorilla to sleep on a perch. In this
respect he resembles man more than the chimpanzee
does, but it is quite certain that neither of
them have the arboreal habit. The gorilla is an
expert climber, but cannot sleep in a tree. In the
hand the tendons which close the fingers are the
same length as the line of the bones, and this permits
him to open the fingers to a straight line,
which the chimpanzee cannot do.</p>

<p>One other important point I desire to mention.
The muscles in the leg of a gorilla will not permit
it to stand or walk erect. The large muscle at the
back of the leg is shorter than the line of the bones
of the leg above and below the knee; and when
this muscle is brought to a tension, those bones
form an angle of about 130 degrees, or thereabouts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
and so long as the sum of two sides of a triangle is
greater than the other side, a gorilla can never
bring his leg into a straight line. In the infant
state the muscle is pliant or elastic, and the bones
less rigid, so that in that state it can be made nearly
straight. The habit of hanging by the arms and
walking with them in a straight line develops the
corresponding muscle in that member, so that the
bones can be brought in line.</p>

<p>The gorilla can stand upon his feet alone, and
walk a few steps in that position; but his motion is
awkward, because his knees turn outward, forming
an angle of 30 or 35 degrees on either
side of the mesial plain. He never attempts to
walk in this position, except at perfect leisure, and
then usually holds on to something with his hands.
The tallest gorilla known, when perfectly erect, is
about 6 feet 2 inches.</p>

<p>The leg of the gorilla from the knee to the ankle
is almost the same size. In the human leg there is
what is called the "calf" of the leg, but this in the
apes is very small; however, there is a slight tendency
in that direction, and it must be noted that
in the human species the calf of the leg appears to
belong to the higher types of men; and as we
descend from the highest races of mankind this
character disappears as we approach the savage.
The pigmies and the bushmen have the smallest of
any other men. It is not to be inferred from this
that apes would ever have this feature developed in
them by elevating them to a higher plane so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
as they remained apes; but it is possible that such
a result would follow in the course of time.</p>

<p>One thing which tends to lessen this in the gorilla
is the size of the muscles about the ankle and the
flexibility of that joint. Also the joint of the knee,
being much larger in proportion to the leg, makes
the calf appear smaller than it really is.</p>

<p>The corresponding part of the arm is more like
that part of the human body.</p>

<p>In a sitting posture the gorilla rests his body upon
the ischial bones, with his legs extended or crossed,
while the chimpanzee usually squats, resting those
bones upon his heels. He sometimes sits, but more
frequently squats. When in these attitudes, both
usually fold their arms across their breasts.</p>

<p>The hair of the gorilla is irregular in growth. It
is more dense than that of the chimpanzee, but less
uniform in size and distribution. On the breast it is
very sparse, on the arms, long, and on the back,
dense, and interspersed with long coarse hairs. The
ground of colour is black, but the extreme end of
the hair is tipped with pale white. This is so in
early youth, and with age the white encroaches,
until, in extreme age, the animal is quite grey. The
top of the head is covered with a thick growth of
short hair, of a dark tan colour, which looks almost
like a wig. This mark seems to be peculiar to
certain localities, but is uniform among those captured
in the Fernan Vaz basin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;"><img id="i_209" src="images/i_209.jpg" width="479" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">YOUNG GORILLA WALKING</div></div>

<p>A white trader living on this lake claims to have
seen a gorilla which was perfectly white. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
seen on the plain near the lake. It was in company
with three or four others. It was thought to be an
albino, but in my opinion it was only a very aged
specimen turned grey. A few of them have been
secured that were almost white. It is not, however,
such a shade of white as would be found in an animal
whose normal colour is white. I cannot vouch for
the colour of this ape seen on the plain, but there
must have been something peculiar in it to attract so
much attention among the natives.</p>

<p>So far, only one species of this ape is known to
science, but there are reasons to believe that two
species exist. In the forest regions of Esyira the
natives described to me another kind of ape, which
they averred was a half-brother to the gorilla. They
know the gorilla by the native name <i xml:lang="nkq" lang="nkq">njina</i>, and the
other type by the name <i xml:lang="nkq" lang="nkq">ntyii</i>. They did not confuse
this with the native name <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ntyigo</i>, which is the name
of the chimpanzee, nor with <i xml:lang="nkq" lang="nkq">kulu-kamba</i>, all of which
are known to them; but they described in detail,
and quite correctly, the three known kinds of ape,
and in addition gave me a minute account of the
appearance and habits of the fourth kind, which I
believe to be another species of the gorilla. They
claim that he is more intelligent and human-like
than any one of the others; and they say that his
superior wisdom makes him more alert, and therefore
more difficult to find. He is said always to live in
parts of the forest most remote from human
habitation.</p>

<p>The dental formula of the gorilla is the same as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
that of man, but the teeth are larger and stronger,
and the canine teeth are developed almost into huge
tusks. One thing to be remarked is the great variety
of malformations in the teeth of this animal. It is a
rare thing to find among them a perfect set of teeth,
except in infancy. The cause of this appears to be
violence or accident.</p>

<p>The eyes of the gorilla are large, dark, and expressive,
but there is no trace of white in them.
That part of the eye which is white in man is a dark
coffee-brown in the gorilla, but becomes lighter as it
approaches the base of the optic nerve. The
taxidermist or the artist, who often furnishes him
with a white spot in the corner of his eye, does
violence to the subject; and those who pose the
animal with his mouth open like a fly-trap, and his
arms raised like a lancer, ought to be banished from
good society. It is true that such things lend an
aspect of ferocity to the creature, but they are
caricatures of the thing they mean to portray.</p>

<p>The ears of the gorilla are very small, and lie
close to the sides of the head. The model of them
is much like the human ear.</p>

<p>I shall not pursue the comparison into minute
details, but leave that to the specialist, in whose
hands it will be treated with more skill and greater
scope. As my especial line of research has been in
the study of their speech and habits, I shall confine
myself to that, but the general comparison I have
made is necessary to a better understanding of the
subject.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />

<span class="subhead">HABITS OF THE GORILLA</span></h2>

<p>A study of the habits of the gorilla in a wild state
is attended with much difficulty, but the results that
I obtained during a sojourn of one year among them
are an ample reward for the efforts made. In a
state of captivity the habits of animals are made to
conform in a measure to their surroundings, and
since those are different many of their habits differ
also. Some are foregone, others modified, and new
ones acquired, therefore we cannot know with certainty
what the animal was in a state of nature. In
the social life of the gorilla there are a few things
perhaps that differ very much from that of the chimpanzee,
but there are some that do in a certain
degree. From the native accounts of the modes of
life of these two apes, there would appear to be a
much greater difference than a systematic study of
them reveals; but the native version of things frequently
has a germ of truth which may serve as a
clue to the facts in the case; and while we cannot
rely upon the tales they relate in all details, we can
forgive the mendacity and make use of the suggestion
they furnish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
It is certain that the gorilla is polygamous in
habit, and it is probable that he has an incipient idea
of government. Within certain limits he has a faint
perception of order and justice, if not of right and
wrong. I do not mean to ascribe to him the highest
attributes of man, or exalt him above the plane to
which his faculties assign him; but there are reasons
to justify the belief that he occupies a higher social
and mental sphere than other animals, except the
chimpanzee.</p>

<p>In the beginning of his career, in independent
life, the gorilla selects a wife with whom he appears
to sustain the conjugal relations thereafter,
and preserves a certain degree of marital fidelity.
From time to time he adopts a new wife, but
does not discard the old one; in this manner he
gathers around him a numerous family, consisting of
his wives and their children. Each mother nurses
and cares for her own young, but all of them grow
up together as the children of one family. There is
no doubt that the mother sometimes corrects and
sometimes chastises her young, which suggests a
vague idea of propriety. The father exercises the
function of patriarch in the sense of a ruler, and the
natives call him <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">ikomba njina</i>, which means gorilla
king. To him the others all show a certain amount
of deference. Whether this is due to fear or to
respect, however, is not certain, but here is at least
the first principle of dignity.</p>

<p>The gorilla family, consisting of this one adult
male and a number of females and their young, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
within themselves a nation. There do not appear
to be any social relations between different families,
but within the same household there is apparent
harmony.</p>

<p>The gorilla is nomadic, and rarely ever spends two
nights in the same place. Each family roams about
in the bush from place to place in search of food, and
wherever they may be when night comes on they
select a place to sleep and retire. The largest
family of gorillas that I have ever heard of was
estimated to contain twenty members. But the
usual number is not more than ten or twelve. The
chimpanzee appears to go in larger groups than
these, and sometimes in a single group two or
even three adult males have been seen. When the
young gorilla approaches the adult state, he leaves
the family group, finds himself a mate, and sets out in
the world for himself. I observed that, as a rule,
when one gorilla was seen alone in the forest it was
usually a young male, but nearly grown; it is probable
that he was then in search of a wife. At other times
two only are seen together, and in this event they
are usually a pair of male and female, and generally
young. Again, it sometimes occurs that three adults
are seen with two or three children; often one of the
children two or three years old, and the others a year
younger, which would indicate that the male had had
one of his wives much longer than the other. In
large families young ones of all ages, from one year
old to five or six years old, are seen; but the fact is
plain that the older children are much fewer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
number. I have once seen a large female with her
babe, quite alone; whether she lived alone or was
only absent for the moment I cannot tell.</p>

<p>The king gorilla does not provide food for his
family, but, on the contrary, it is said they provide
for him. I have been informed on two occasions,
from different sources, that the king gorilla has been
seen sitting quietly under the shade of a tree, eating,
while the others collected and brought to him the
food. I have never witnessed such a scene myself,
but it does not seem probable that the same story
would have come from two sources unless there was
some foundation for it.</p>

<p>In the matter of government, the gorilla appears
to be somewhat more advanced than most animals.
He leads the others on the march, and selects their
feeding grounds and places to sleep; he breaks camp,
and the others all obey him in these respects.
Other animals that travel in groups do the same
thing; but in addition to this, the natives aver that
the gorillas from time to time hold palavers or a rude
form of court or council in the jungle. On these
occasions, it is said the king presides; that he sits
alone in the centre, while the others stand or sit in a
rough semicircle about him, and talk in an excited
manner. Sometimes the whole of them are talking
at once, but what it means or alludes to no native
undertakes to say, except that it has the nature of a
quarrel. To what extent the king gorilla exercises
the judicial function is a matter of grave doubt, but
there appears to be some real ground for the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
As to the succession of the kingship there is no
certainty, but the facts point to the belief that on
the death of the king, if there be an adult male he
assumes the royal prerogative, otherwise the family
disbands, and they are absorbed by or attached to
other families. Whether this new leader is elected
in the manner that other animals appoint a leader, or
assumes it by reason of his age, cannot be said; but
there is no doubt that in many instances families
remain intact for a time after the death of their
leader.</p>

<p>It has been said by many that the gorilla builds a
rude hut or shelter for himself and family, but I have
found no evidence that such is true. The natives
declare that he does so, and some white men affirm
the same; but during my travels through their
habitat, I offered liberal and frequent rewards to any
native who would show me one of these specimens
of simian architecture, but I was never able to find
any trace of one made or occupied by any ape.
They may sometimes, and doubtless do, take shelter
from the tornadoes, but it is always under some
fallen tree or cluster of broad leaves, and there is
nothing to show that they arrange any part of them.
So far as I could find, there is no proof that any
gorilla ever put two sticks together with the idea of
shelter. As to his throwing sticks or stones at an
enemy, I have found nothing to verify it; in my
opinion, it is a mere freak of fancy.</p>

<p>The current opinion or idea that a gorilla will
attack a man without being provoked to it, is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
error. He is shy and timid, and shrinks alike from
man and other large animals. I have no doubt that
when he is in a rage he is both fierce and powerful,
but his ferocity and strength are rated above their
true value. In combat he is a stubborn foe no doubt,
but no one that I have met has ever seen him thus
engaged.</p>

<p>The mode of attack as described by many travellers
is a mere theory. It is said in this act he walks
erect, beats with fury on his breast, roars and yells,
and in this manner seizes his adversary, tears open
his breast, and drinks the blood. I have never seen
a large gorilla in the act of assault. During the
time of my stay in the jungle I had a young gorilla
in captivity, and I made use of him in studying the
habits of his race. I kept him tied with a long line
which allowed him room to play and climb, and at
the same time prevented him from escaping into the
forest, which he always tried to do the instant he
was released. I released him frequently for the
purpose of watching his mode of attack when recaptured.
While being pursued he rarely looked back,
but when overtaken he invariably assailed his captor.
This gave me an opportunity of seeing his method of
attack, in which he displayed both skill and judgment.
As my boy would approach him, he would
calmly turn with one side to the foe and, without
facing the boy, would roll his eyes in such a manner
as to see him and at the same time conceal his
purpose. When the boy came within reach, the
gorilla would grasp him with a thrust of the arm to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
one side and slightly backward. When he had
seized his adversary by the leg, he would instantly
swing the other arm round with a long sweep and
strike the boy a hard blow; then he began to use
his teeth. He seemed to depend more upon the
blow than the grasp, but the latter served to hold
the object of attack within reach; in every case he
kept one arm and one leg in reserve until he had
seized his adversary. It is true that these attacks
were made upon an enemy in pursuit, but his mode
appeared to be a normal one; he could strike a severe
blow, and did not show any sign of tearing or
scratching his opponent. In these attacks he made
no sound of any kind. I do not pretend to say that
other gorillas do not scream or tear their victims, but
I take it that the habits of the young are much, if
not quite, the same as those of their parents, and
from a study of this specimen I am forced to modify
many opinions imbibed from reading or from pictures
and specimens which I have seen. Many of them
represent the gorilla in absurd and sometimes impossible
attitudes. They certainly do not represent him
as I have seen him in his native wilds.</p>

<p>When the chimpanzee attacks, so far as I have
seen among my own specimens, he approaches his
enemy and strikes with both hands, one slightly in
advance of the other. After striking a few blows,
he will grasp his opponent and use his teeth, then
shoving him away again uses his hands, and usually,
on beginning the attack, accompanies the assault
with a loud, piercing scream. Neither he nor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
gorilla closes the hand to strike, nor uses any weapon
except the hands and teeth. I had another young
female gorilla for a short time as a subject for study.
Her mode of attack appeared to be the same, but
she was too large to risk in such experiments.</p>

<p>I have read and heard descriptions of the sounds
made by the gorilla, but nothing ever conveyed
to my mind an adequate idea of their true nature,
until I heard them myself within a few hundred
feet of my cage in the dead of night. By some it
has been called roaring, and by others howling;
but it is neither truly a roar nor a howl. They
utter a peculiar combination of sounds, beginning
in a low, smooth tone, which rapidly increases
in pitch and frequency, until it becomes a terrific
scream. The first part of the series is quite within
the scope of the human voice, but as it rises in pitch
and increases in volume it passes far beyond the
reach of the human lungs. The first sound of the
series and each alternate sound is made by expiration,
while the intermediate ones appear to be by
inspiration, but how it is accomplished is difficult to
say. The sound as a whole resembles the braying
of an ass, except the notes are shorter, the climax
higher, and the sound is louder. A gorilla does not
yell in this manner every night, but when he does so
it is usually between two and five o'clock in the
morning; I have never heard the sound during the
day nor in the early part of the night. When he
thus screams, he repeats the series from ten to
twenty times, at intervals of one or two minutes each.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
I know of nothing in the way of vocal sounds that
can inspire such terror as the voice of the gorilla. It
can be heard over a distance of three or four miles.
I could assign no definite meaning to it unless it was
intended to alarm some intruder that came too
near.</p>

<p>One morning between three and four o'clock I
heard two of them screaming at the same time. I
do not mean to say at the same instant, but at
intervals during the same period of time. One of
them was within about a third of a mile of me, and
the other in another direction perhaps a mile away.
The points we occupied respectively formed a
scalene triangle. The sounds did not appear to
have any reference to each other. Sometimes they
would alternate, and at other times they would
interrupt each other. They were both made by
giants of their kind, and every leaf in the forest
vibrated with the sound. This was during the latter
part of May. They do scream in this way from time
to time throughout the year, but it is most frequent
and violent during February and March.</p>

<p>This wild screaming is sometimes accompanied by
a peculiar beating sound. It has been described by
travellers, and currently believed to be made by the
animal beating with his hands upon his breast; but
such is not the case. It is very certain that the
sound cannot be made by that means. The quality
of the sound shows that such cannot be the means
employed. I have heard this beating several times,
and have paid marked attention to its character. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
a great distance it would be difficult to discern the
exact quality; but on one occasion, while stopping
over-night in a native town, I was aroused from sleep
by a gorilla screaming and beating within a few
hundred yards. I put on my boots, took my rifle,
and cautiously crossed the open ground between the
village and the forest. This brought me within
about two hundred yards of the animal. The moon
was faintly shining, but I could not see the beast,
and I had no desire to approach nearer at such a
time, but I heard distinctly every stroke. I believe
the sound was made by beating upon a log or piece
of dead wood. He was beating with both hands, the
strokes alternating with great rapidity, and not unlike
the manner in which the natives beat a drum, except
that the hand made the same number of strokes,
and the strokes were in a constant series, rising
and falling from very soft to very loud, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versâ</i>.
A number of these runs followed one another during
the time the voice continued. Between the first and
second strokes the interval was slightly longer than
that between the second and third, and so on through
the scale. As the beating increased in loudness the
interval shortened in an inverse degree, while in
descending the scale the intervals lengthened as the
beating softened, and the author of the sound was
conscious of this fact. I could trace no relation in
time or harmony between the sound of the voice and
the beating, except that they began at the same time
and ended at the same time. The same series of
vocal sounds was repeated each time, beginning on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the low note and ending on the highest note or
pitch in each case, while the rise and fall of the
series of the beaten sounds was not measured by the
duration of the voice. The series each time began
with a soft note, but ended at any part of the scale at
which the voice ceased, and was not the same in
every case.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;"><img id="i_223" src="images/i_223.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">NATIVE CARRIER BOY</div></div>

<p>I have no doubt that the gorilla beats upon his
breast: he has been seen to do so in captivity, but
the sounds described above were not so made. Since
the gorilla makes these sounds only at night, it is
not probable that any man ever saw him in the act.
It does not require a delicate sense of hearing to
distinguish a sound made by beating the breast from
that of dead wood or other similar substance.</p>

<p>I have attributed the above sound to the gorilla,
because I have been assured by many white men
and scores of natives that it was made by him; but
since my return from Africa I have had time to
consider and digest certain facts tabulated on
that trip, and as a result I am led to doubt whether
this sound is made by the gorilla or not. There are
good reasons to believe that it is made by the chimpanzee
instead, and I shall state them.</p>

<p>I observed that my own chimpanzees made this
sound exactly the same as that I heard in the forest,
except that it was less in volume, which was due to
their age. I could induce them at any time to make
the sound, and frequently did so in order to study it.
On my arrival in New York I found that Chico,
the big chimpanzee belonging to Mr. Bailey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
frequently made the same sound at night. It was
said to be so loud and piercing that it fairly shook
the stately walls of Madison Square Garden.
From reading the description given by the late
Professor Romanes of the sound made by "Sally"
in the London Gardens, it appears to be the same
sound.</p>

<p>It is well known to the natives that the chimpanzees
beat on some sonorous body, which they call
a drum. Four years ago I called attention to the
habit of the two chimpanzees in the Cincinnati
Gardens. They frequently indulged in beating upon
the floor of their cage with their knuckles. This
was done chiefly by the male. The late E.&nbsp;J.
Glave described to me the same thing, as being
done by the chimpanzees in the Middle Congo
basin.</p>

<p>It is not probable that two animals of different
genera utter the same exact sound, and this is more
especially true of a sound that is complex or prolonged.
Neither is it likely that the two would
have a common habit, such as beating on any
sonorous body. Since it is certain that one of these
apes does make the sound described, it is more than
probable that the other does not. The same logic
applies to the beating.</p>

<p>Many things that are known of the chimpanzee
are taken for granted in the gorilla, but it is erroneous
to suppose that in such habits as these they would
be identical. In some cases I have been able to
prove quite conclusively that the chimpanzee alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
did certain things which were ascribed to the
gorilla.</p>

<p>In view of these facts alone, I am inclined to
believe that after all, the sound described is made by
the chimpanzee and not by the gorilla.</p>

<p>Another case in which the gorilla is portrayed is
wrong. The female gorilla is represented as carrying
her young clinging to her waist. I have seen
the mother in the forest with her young mounted
upon her back, with its arms around her neck and
its feet hooked in her armpits. I have never seen
the male carry the young, but in a number of specimens
of advanced age I have seen a mark upon the
back and sides which indicates that he does so. It is
in the same place that the young rest upon the back
of the mother. In form it is like an inverted <b>Y</b>, with
the base resting on the neck and the prongs reaching
under the arms. This mark is not one of nature, but
appears to be the imprint of something carried there.
In a few specimens the hair is worn off until the skin
is almost bare. The prongs are more worn than the
stem of the figure, which is due to the fact that more
weight is borne upon those parts than elsewhere. I
do not assert that such is the cause, but it is worthy
of note that such is the fact.</p>

<p>The gorilla is averse to human society. He is
morose and sullen in captivity. He frets and pines
for his liberty. His face appears to be incapable of
expressing anything like a smile, but when in repose
it is not repugnant. In anger his visage depicts the
savage instincts of his nature. The one which lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
with me for a time in the forest was a sober, solemn,
stoical creature, and nothing could arouse in him
a spirit of mirth. The only pastime he indulged in
was turning somersaults. Almost every day, at
intervals of an hour or so, he would stand up for a
moment, then put his head upon the ground, turn
over like a boy, rise to his feet again, and look at me
as if expecting my applause. He would frequently
repeat this act a dozen times or more, but never
smiled or evinced any sign of pleasure. He was
selfish, cruel, vindictive, and retiring.</p>

<p>One peculiar habit of the gorilla, both wild and in
captivity, is that of relaxing the lower lip when in
repose. They drop the lid until a small red line
appears across the mouth from side to side. It is
not done when in a sullen mood, but when perplexed
or in a deep study.</p>

<p>Another constant habit is to protrude the end of
the tongue between the lips, until it is about even
with the outer edge of them. The end of the tongue
is somewhat more blunted than that of the human.
This habit is so frequent with the young gorilla that
it would appear to have some meaning, but I cannot
suggest what it is.</p>

<p>The habit of the gorilla, in sleeping, is to lie upon
the back or side, with one or both arms placed under
the head as a pillow. He cannot sleep on a perch,
as we have already noted, but lies upon the ground
at night. I had once pointed out to me the place at
the base of a large tree where a school of them had
slept the night before. One imprint was quite distinct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
The stories told about the king gorilla placing
his family in a tree while he sits on watch at the base,
is another case of supposition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 457px;"><img id="i_229" src="images/i_229.jpg" width="457" height="411" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">A YOUNG GORILLA ASLEEP</div></div>

<p>The food of the gorilla is not confined to plants and
fruits. They are fond of meat, and eat it either raw
or cooked. They secure a small supply by catching
rodents of various kinds, lizards and toads; they are
also known to rob the nests of birds of the eggs, and
of the young. A native once pointed out to me the
quills and bones of a porcupine which he said had
been left by a gorilla who had eaten the carcass, and
he said that it was not at all rare for them to do so.
The fruits and plants they live upon chiefly are
acidulous in taste, and some of them are bitter. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
often eat the fruit of the plantain, but prefer the
stalk, which they twist and break open and eat the
succulent heart of the plant. They do the same
with the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">batuna</i>, which grows all through the forest.
The fruit of this plant is a red pod filled with seeds
imbedded in a soft pulp, it is slightly acidulate and
astringent. The wild mangrove which forms a
staple article of food for the chimpanzee is rarely, if
ever, touched by the gorilla, and the same is true of
many other plants and fruits. I once saw a gorilla
try to seize a dog, but whether it was for the purpose
of eating the flesh or not I cannot say. One, however,
did catch and devour a small dog on board the
steamer <i class="anatomy">ship</i>, while on a voyage home from Africa.
Both belonged to Captain Button, who assured me
of the fact. They have no fixed hours for eating,
but usually do so in the early morning or late afternoon.
I have, in a few instances, seen them refuse
meat. They are perhaps less devoted to eating
flesh than the chimpanzee.</p>

<p>In the act of drinking, the gorilla will take a cup,
place the rim in his mouth and drink like a human
being. He does this without being taught, while
the chimpanzee prefers to put both lips in the vessel.
I have never known one that would drink beer,
spirits, coffee or soup, but their drink is limited to
milk or water, while the chimpanzee drinks beer and
other things as well.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />

<span class="subhead">OTHELLO AND OTHER GORILLAS</span></h2>

<p>While I was living in my cage in the jungle I
secured a young gorilla, to whom I gave the name
"Othello." He was about one year old, strong,
hardy and robust. I found him to be a fine subject
for study, and made the best use of him for that
purpose. I have elsewhere described his character,
but his illness and death are matters of profound
interest.</p>

<p>At noon on the day of his decease he was quite
well and in fine humour. He was turning somersaults
and playing like a child with my native boy.
In his play he evinced a certain interest, and his
actions indicated that it gave him pleasure, but his
face never once betrayed the fact. It was amusing
to see him with the actions of a romping child and
the face of a cynic.</p>

<p>He was supplied with plenty of native food, had a
good appetite, and ate with a relish. Just after noon
I sent the boy on an errand, and he was expected to
return about night. Near the middle of the afternoon
I observed that Othello was ill; he declined to
eat or drink, and lay on his back on the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
with his arms under his head as a pillow. I tried to
induce him to walk with me, to play, or to sit up,
but he refused to do so. By four o'clock he was
very ill. He rolled from side to side, and groaned
as if in pain. He kept one hand upon his stomach,
where the pain appeared to be located. He displayed
all the symptoms of gastric poisoning, and I
have reason to believe now that the boy had given
him poison. I should regret to foster this suspicion
against an innocent person, but it is based upon
certain facts that I have learned since that time.</p>

<p>While I sat in my cage watching Othello, who lay
on the ground a short distance away, I discovered a
native approaching him from the jungle. The man
had an uplifted spear in his hand, as if in the act of
hurling it at something. He had not seen me, but
it did not for the moment occur to me that he had
designs upon my pet. I spoke to him in the native
language, when he explained that he had seen the
young gorilla, and from that fact suspected there was
an old one close at hand, for whose attack he was
prepared: that he was not afraid of the little one,
but desired to capture it. I informed him that my
gorilla was ill. He examined it, and assured me
that it would die. The man departed, and Othello
continued to grow worse. His sighing and groaning
were really touching. I gave him an emetic, which
took effect with good results. I also used some
vaperoles to resuscitate him, but my skill was not
sufficient to meet the demands of his case.</p>

<p>His conduct was so like that of a human being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
that it deeply impressed me, and being alone with
him in the silence of the dreary forest at the time
of his demise, gave the scene a touch of sadness
that impressed me with a deeper sense of its reality;
and Moses watched the dying ape as if he knew
what it meant. He showed no signs of regret, but
his manner was such as to suggest that he knew it
was a trying hour.</p>

<p>Othello died just before sunset, but for a long
time prior to this he was unconscious. The only
movements made by him were spasmodic actions of
the muscles caused by pain. The fixed and vacant
stare of his eyes in this last hour was so like those
of man in the hour of dissolution, that no one could
look upon the scene and fail to realise the solemn
fact that this was death. The next day I dissected
him, and prepared the skin and skeleton to bring
home with me. They are now, with Moses and
others, in the Museum of the University of Toronto;
and if the taxidermist who mounts the skin of Othello
poses him like most of the craft do&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in the attitude
of dancing a fandango and the corners of his mouth
forming obtuse angles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I will have that man executed
if I have to bribe the court.</p>

<p>When I first secured this ape and brought him to
my home in the bush, he was placed on the ground
a few feet from my cage, and near him was laid
some bananas and sugar-cane for Moses, who had
not yet seen the stranger. The gorilla was in a
box with one side open, so that he could easily be
seen. My purpose was to see how each one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
act on discovering the other. When Moses observed
the food he proceeded to help himself. On seeing
the gorilla he paused a moment and gave me an
alarm, but he was not himself deterred from taking
a banana, which he seized and retreated. While he
was eating the banana, I took the gorilla from the
cage and set him on the ground by it. I petted
him, and gave him some food. Moses looked on,
but did not interfere. I returned to my cage, and
Moses proceeded to investigate the new ape. He
approached slowly and cautiously within about
three feet of it. He walked around it a couple of
times, keeping his face towards it, and gradually
getting a little nearer. At length he stopped by
one side of the gorilla, and came up within a few
inches of it. He appeared to stand almost on tiptoe,
with only the ends of his fingers touching the
ground. The gorilla continued to eat his food without
so much as giving him a look. Moses placed
his mouth near the ear of the gorilla and gave one
terrific yell. But the gorilla did not flinch or even
turn his eyes. Moses stood for a moment looking
at him as if in surprise that he had made no impression.
After this time he made many overtures to
make friends with the gorilla, but the latter did not
entertain them with favour beyond maintaining terms
of peace. They never quarrelled, but Othello always
treated him as an inferior. I do not know if he
entertained a real feeling of contempt, but his manner
was such.</p>

<p>There were but few articles of food that he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Moses liked in common, and therefore they had no
occasion to quarrel; but they never played together
or cultivated any friendly terms as the chimpanzees
did among themselves. This may have been due to
the gorilla, who was so exclusive in his demeanour
towards the chimpanzee as to forbid all attempts of
the latter to become intimate. The chimpanzee by
nature is more sociable and is fond of human society.
He imitates the actions of man in many things, and
quickly adapts himself to new conditions, while the
gorilla is selfish and retiring. He can seldom, if ever,
be reconciled to human society; he does not imitate
man nor yield to the influences of civilised life.</p>

<p>One special trait of the gorilla which I wish to
emphasise is that he is one of the most taciturn, if
not quite the most, of any member of the simian
family. This fact does not appear to confirm my
theory as to their high type of speech, but it is a fact
so far as I observed, although the natives say that
they are as loquacious as the chimpanzee. Among
the specimens that I have studied, both wild and in
captivity, I have never heard but four sounds that
differed from each other, and of these only two
could properly be defined as speech. I do not
include the screaming sound described in another
chapter. I have not been able so far to translate the
sounds that I have heard, and they cannot be spelled
with letters. There is one sound which Othello
often used. It was not a speech sound, but a kind of
whine, always coupled with a deep sigh. When left
alone for a time he became oppressed with solitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
At such times he would heave a deep sigh and utter
this strange sound. The tone and manner strongly
appealed to the feelings of others, and while he did
not appear to address it to any one or have any
design in making it, it always touched a sympathetic
chord, and I was sometimes tempted to release him.
Another sound which was not within the pale of
speech was a kind of grumbling sound. This frequently
occurred when he was eating. It was not a
growl in the proper sense, but was in a way a kind
of complaint. Twice I heard this same sound made
by wild ones in the forest near my cage. The only
thing that I can compare it to in its use is that habit
of a cat while eating, to make a peculiar growling
sound, which appears to be done only when something
else is near. It is possibly intended to deter
others from trying to take the food.</p>

<p>During my life in the cage I saw a number of
gorillas, but I shall only describe a few of them, as
their actions were similar in most instances.</p>

<p>The first one that I had the pleasure of seeing in
the jungle came within a few yards of the cage
before it was yet in order to receive. He was not
half grown. He must have been attracted by the
noise made in putting it together. He advanced
with caution, and when I discovered him he was
peering through the bushes as if to ascertain the
cause of the sounds. When he saw me, he only
tarried a few seconds and hurried off into the jungle.
I did not disturb or shoot at him, because I desired
him to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
On the third day after I went to live in the cage
a family of ten gorillas was seen to cross an open
space along the back of a patch of plantains near one
of the villages. A small native boy was within
about twenty yards of them when they crossed the
path in front of him. A few minutes later I was
notified of it, took my rifle, and followed them into
the jungle until I lost the trail. A few hours after
this they were again seen by some natives not far
away from my cage, but they did not come near
enough to be seen or heard. The next day there
was a family came within some thirty yards of the
cage. The bush was so dense that I could not see
them, but I could distinguish four or five voices.
They seemed to be engaged in a broil of some kind.
I suppose it was the same family that had been seen
the day before. The second night after this time I
heard the screams of one in the forest some distance
from me, but I do not know whether it was the king
of this family or another.</p>

<p>One day, as I sat alone, a young gorilla, perhaps
five years old, came within six or seven yards of the
cage and took a peep. I do not know whether he
was aware of its being there or not until he was so
near. He stood for a time, almost erect, with one
hand holding on to a bough; his lower lip was
relaxed, showing the red line mentioned above, and
the end of his tongue could be seen between his
parted lips. He did not evince either fear or anger,
but rather appeared to be amazed. I heard him
creeping through the bush a few seconds before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
saw him, but as a rule they move so stealthily as not
to be heard. I know of no other animal of equal
weight that makes so little noise in going through
the forest. During the short time he stood gazing
at me I sat still as a statue, and I think he was in
doubt as to whether I was alive or not. He did not
turn and run away, but after a brief pause turned off
at an angle and departed. He lost no time, but
made no great haste. The only sound he made was
a low grunt, and this he did not repeat.</p>

<p>At another time I heard two making a noise
among the plantains near me. I could only obtain
a glimpse of them, but as well as I could see they
were of good size, being almost grown. They were
making a low sound from time to time, something
like I have described, but I could not see them well
enough to frame any opinion as to what it meant.
They were certainly not quarrelling, and I am not
sure that they were eating, for I afterwards went
and looked to see if I could find where they had
broken any of the stalks. Their trail was visible
through the grass and weeds, but I could find no
stalk broken. They were moving at a very leisurely
gait, and must have been within hearing ten or
twelve minutes. They were quite alike in colour,
and appeared to be so in size, although it is well
known that the adult male attains a much greater
size than the female.</p>

<p>On one occasion when I was standing outside of
the cage some twenty yards away, Moses was sitting
on a dead log near by. I turned to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
was just in the act of sitting down by him when he
gave an alarm. I looked around, and discovered a
gorilla standing not more than twenty yards away.
He had just that moment discovered us. He gazed
for a few moments and started on, moving
obliquely towards the cage. I turned to retreat.
At this instant Moses gave one of his piercing
screams, which frightened the gorilla and he fled.
He changed his course almost at right angles. He
was going at a good rate before Moses screamed,
but he mended it at once.</p>

<p>One day I heard three sounds which my boy
assured me were gorillas; they were in different
directions from the cage. It was not a scream nor
a howl, but somewhat resembled the human voice
calling out with a sound like "he-oo!" This sound
was repeated at intervals, but did not appear to be
in the relation of call and answer, and the animals
making them did not approach each other while
doing so. The sounds were the same except in
volume, and one of them appeared to be made by a
much larger animal than the other two. I must say
that this sound rarely occurred within my hearing
during all my stay in that part, and with the exception
of this time I never heard them make any loud
sound during the day.</p>

<p>Another interesting specimen that I saw came
prowling through the jungle as if he had lost his
way. He found a small opening, or tunnel, which
I had cut through the foliage in order to get a
better view. Turning into that, he came a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
steps towards the cage before he discovered it.
Suddenly he stopped, squatted on the ground, but
did not sit flat down. For a few seconds he was
motionless, and so was I. He slowly raised one
arm till his hand was above his head, in which position
he sat for a few seconds, when he moved his
hand quickly forward as if to motion at me. He
did not drop his hand to the ground, but held it
at an angle from his face for a short time, then
slowly let it down till it reached the ground.
During this time he kept his eyes fixed on me. At
length he raised the other arm and seized hold of a
strong bush, by which he slowly drew himself in a half-standing
position. Thus he stood for a few seconds,
with one hand resting on the ground. Suddenly he
turned to one side, parted the bushes, and instantly
disappeared. He uttered no sound whatever.</p>

<p>Another visitor that came within about thirty
yards along the open path which led to my retreat,
stopped when he discovered me, and stared in a
perplexed manner. He turned away to retreat, but
only went a few feet, turned around, and sat down
on the ground. He remained in that attitude for
more than half a minute, when he arose and retired
in the direction from which he came.</p>

<p>The finest view that I ever had of any specimen,
and at the same time the best subject for study,
was a large female that came within a trifle more
than three yards of me. There was a dog that
belonged to a village a mile or two away that had
become attached to me, and had found its way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
through the bush to my cage. He frequently came
to visit me in my retreat, and I was always glad to
welcome him. One afternoon, about three o'clock,
he came, and I let him in the cage for a while to
pass the usual greetings. I had a bone of a goat
which I had saved from my last meal, and I threw
this out to him in the bush a few feet away from
the cage. He seized the bone, and began to gnaw
it where it lay. His body was in the opening of a
rough path cut through the jungle near the cage,
but his head was concealed under a clump of leaves.
All at once I caught a glimpse of some moving
object at the edge of the path on the opposite side
of the cage. It was a huge female gorilla, carrying
a young one on her back. When I first saw her
she was not more than thirty feet away. She was
creeping along the edge of the bushes and watching
the dog, who was busy with the bone. Her
tread was so stealthy that I could not hear the
rustle of a leaf. She advanced a few feet, crouched
under the edge of the bushes, and cautiously peeped
at the dog. She advanced again a little way, halted,
crouched, and peeped again. It was evident that
her purpose was to attack, and her approach was so
wary as to leave no doubt of her dexterity in attacking
a foe. Every movement was the embodiment
of stealth. Her face wore a look of anxiety with a
touch of ferocity. Her movements were quick but
accurate, and her advance was not delayed by any
indecision. The dog had not discovered her, and
the smell of the bone and the noise he was making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
with it prevented his either smelling or hearing her.
I could not warn him without alarming her. If he
could have seen her before she made the attack, I
should have left him to take his chances by flight or
by battle. I should have been glad of an opportunity
to witness such a combat and to study the
actions of the belligerents, but I could not consent
to see a friendly dog taken at such disadvantage.
She was now rapidly covering the distance between
them, and the dog had not yet discovered her.
When she reached a point within about four yards
of him I determined to break the silence. I cocked
my rifle, and the click of the trigger caught her
attention. I think this was the first thing that
made her aware of my presence. She instantly
stopped, turned her face and body towards the cage,
and sat down on the ground in front of it. She
gave me such a look that I almost felt ashamed of
having interfered. She sat for fully one minute
staring at me as if she had been transfixed. There
was no trace of anger or of fear, but the look of
surprise was on every feature. I could see her eyes
move from my head to my feet. She scanned me
as closely as if it had been her purpose to purchase
me. At length she glanced at the dog, who was
still eating the bone, then turned her head uneasily,
as if to search for some way of escape. She rose,
and retraced her steps with moderate haste; she
did not run, but lost no time. She glanced back
from time to time to see that she was not pursued.
She uttered no sound of any kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
From the time this ape came in view until she
departed was about four minutes, and during that
time I was afforded an opportunity of studying her
in a way that no one else has ever been able to do.
I watched every movement of her body, face and
eyes. I could sit with perfect composure and study
her without the fear of attack. With due respect
for the temerity of men, I do not believe that any
sane man could calmly sit and watch one of these
huge beasts approach so near him without feeling a
tremor of fear, unless he was protected as I was.
Any man would either shoot or retreat, and he could
not possibly study the subject with equanimity.</p>

<p>The temptation to shoot her was almost too great
to resist, and the desire to capture her babe made it
all the more so; but up to that time I had refrained
from firing my gun anywhere within a radius of half
a mile or so of my cage, and the natives had agreed
to the same thing. My purpose in doing so was to
avoid frightening the apes away from the locality. I
had been told by the native hunters before this, that
if I wounded one of them the others would leave the
vicinity and not return perhaps for weeks. They
say if you kill one the others do not appear to
notice it so much as if it were wounded, although
they seem to be aware of the fact and for the time
flee, but will return again within a short time.</p>

<p>I could have shot this one with perfect ease and
safety. As she approached, her head and breast
were towards me; just before she discovered me her
left side was in plain view, and when she sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
her breast was perfectly exposed, so that I could
have shot her in the heart, the breast, or the head.</p>

<p>Her baby lay upon her back, with its arms embracing
her neck and its feet caught under her arms.
The cunning little imp saw me long before the
mother did, but it gave her no warning of danger.
It lay with its cheek resting on the back of her head.
Its black face looked as smooth and soft as velvet.
Its big brown eyes were looking straight at me, but
it betrayed no sign of fear or even of concern. It
really had a pleased expression, and was the nearest
approach to a smile I have ever seen on the face of
a gorilla. I believe that this is their method of
carrying the young, and I have elsewhere assigned
other reasons for this belief. In this case it is not a
matter of belief, but one of knowledge, and everything
that I have observed conspires to say that this is no
exception to the rule.</p>

<p>During my sojourn of nearly four months in the
jungle, where it was said the greatest number of
gorillas could be found of any other place in the
basin of that lake, I only saw a total of twenty-two,
besides one other that I saw at another time in the
forest while I was hunting. I only caught a glimpse
of him, and should not even have done that had not
the native guide discovered and pointed him out to
me. I believe that no other white man has ever
seen an equal number of these animals in a wild
state, and it is certain that no other has ever seen
them under as favourable conditions for study. I
have compared notes with many white men on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
part of the coast, but I have never found any reliable
man who claims to have seen an equal number. I
know men there who have lived in that part for
years, who frequently hunt in the forest for days at
a time, and yet never saw a live gorilla. I met one
man on my last voyage who has lived on the edge
of the gorilla country forty-nine years, makes frequent
journeys through the bush and along the watercourses
in the interest of trade, and this man told me
himself that in all that time he had never seen a
wild gorilla. I would cite Mr. James A. Deemin as
an expert woodsman, a cool, daring hunter, and I
have enjoyed several hunts with him. He has
travelled, traded, and hunted through the gorilla
country for more than thirteen years, and has told
me that with one exception he had never seen but
one wild gorilla. This was a young one, and the
exception alluded to was that he one time saw a
school of them at a distance. On this occasion he
was in a canoe and under the cover of the bushes
along the side of a river until he came near them
unobserved. Another man, whose name I will take
the liberty of giving, is Mr. J.&nbsp;H. Drake, of Liverpool.
Mr. Drake has never been suspected by those
who know him of lacking courage in the hunt or
being given to romance, and yet in many years on
the coast he never saw but one school of these apes,
and that was the same one that Mr. Deemin saw
when they were travelling together. I could cite
many others to show that it is a rare thing for the
most expert woodsman ever to see one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
creatures, and many of the stories told by the casual
traveller cannot be received with implicit faith. I
do not mean to impeach the veracity of others, but
fancy must have something to do with the case.
While we cannot prove the negative by direct
evidence, we must be permitted to doubt whether or
not these apes are so frequently met in the jungle as
they are alleged to be. I will give some reasons
why I am a sceptic on this subject.</p>

<p>Almost every yarn told by the novice is quite the
same in substance and much the same in detail as
those related by others. It seems that most of them
meet the same old gorilla, still beating his breast and
screaming just as he did thirty years ago. The
number of gun-barrels that he is accused of having
chewed up would make an arsenal that would arm
the volunteers. What becomes of all those that are
attacked by this fierce monarch of the jungle? Not
one of them ever gets killed, and not one of them
ever kills a gorilla. Does he merely do this as a
bluff and then recede from the attack? Or does he
follow it up and seize his victim, tear him open and
drink his blood as he is supposed to do? How does
the victim escape? What becomes of the assailant?
Who lives to tell the tale?</p>

<p>The gorilla has good ears, good eyes, and is a
skilful bushman. One man walking through the
jungle will make more noise than half a dozen
gorillas. The gorilla can always see and hear a man
before he is seen or heard by him. He is shy, and
will not attack a man unless he is disturbed by him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
He is always on the alert for danger, and rarely
comes into the open parts of the bush except for
food. He can conceal himself with more ease than
a man can, and has every advantage in making his
escape. I do not believe that he will ever approach
a man if he can evade him. I quite believe that he
will make a strong defence if surprised or attacked,
but I do not believe it possible for any one to see a
great number of gorillas in any length of time unless
he goes to some one place and remains there as I
have done. Even then he must sometimes wait for
days without a trace of one. Silence and patience
alone will enable him to see them; but when the
gorilla sees him he at once retires as soon as he
discovers the nature of the thing before him. He
does not always flee in haste as many other animals
do, but is more deliberate and cool. He will retreat
in good order, and as a rule always starts in time if
possible to escape without being observed. I trust
that I may be pardoned for not being able to believe
that every stranger who visits that country is
attacked by a gorilla.</p>

<p>In addition to those I have seen in a wild state, I
have seen about ten in captivity. Two of those were
my own. They were good subjects for study, and I
made the best use of them for the time I had them.</p>

<p>I accomplished one thing while in the jungle, for
which I feel a just sense of pride, and that was
making a gorilla take a portrait of himself. This
will interest the amateur in the art of snapshots, and
I shall relate it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
I selected a place in the forest where I found some
tracks of the animal along the edge of a dense
thicket of <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">batuna</i>. Under cover of the foliage I set
up two pairs of stakes which were crossed at the
tops, and to them was lashed a short pole forming
something like a sawbuck. To this was fastened
the camera, to which had been attached a trigger
made of bamboo splits. One end of a string was
fastened to the trigger, and the other end carried
under a yoke to a distance of eight feet from the
lens. At this point was attached a fresh plantain
stalk and a nice bunch of the red fruit of the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">batuna</i>.
Upon this point the camera was focussed, the trigger
was set, and it was left to await the gorilla. That
afternoon I returned to find that something had
taken the bait, broken the string, sprung the trigger
and snapped the camera. I developed the plate, but
could find no image of anything except the leaves in
front of it. I repeated the experiment with the
same results, but could not understand how anything
could steal the bait and yet not be shown in the
picture. The third time I did this I was gratified to
find the image of a gorilla, and also to discover the
cause why the others had not succeeded. The deep
shadows of the forest make it difficult to take a
photograph without giving it a time exposure, and
when the sun is under a cloud or on the wrong side
of an object it is quite impossible. The leaves that
were shown in the first two plates were only those
which were most exposed to the light, and all the
lower part of the picture was without detail. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
third trial it could be seen that the sun was shining
at the instant of exposure. A part of the body of
the gorilla was in the light, but most of it was in the
shadow of the leaves above it. The left side of the
head and face were quite distinct, also the left
shoulder and arm. The hand and bait could not
have been distinguished except by their context.
The right side of the head, arm, and most of the
body were lost. The picture showed that he had
taken the bait with his left hand, and that he was in
a crouching posture at the moment. While the
photograph was very poor as a work of art, it was
full of interest as an experiment.</p>

<p>Although it did not result in getting a good
picture, I do not regard the effort as a failure. It
shows at least that such a thing is possible, and by
careful efforts often repeated it could be made a
means of obtaining some novel pictures. A little
ingenuity would widen the scope of this device, and
make it possible to photograph birds, elephants, and
everything else in the forest. When I return to
that place on a like journey, I shall carry the scheme
into better effect.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />

<span class="subhead">OTHER APES</span></h2>

<p>In the various records that constitute the history of
these apes are found many novel and incoherent
tales, but all of them appear to rest upon some basis
of truth. In order to arrive at some more definite
knowledge concerning them, we may review the
data at our command. The first record in the annals
of the world that alludes to these man-like apes, is
that of Hanno, who made a voyage from Carthage to
the west coast of Africa, nearly 500 years before the
Christian era. He described an ape which was found
in the locality about Sierra Leone. It is singular that
the description which he gave of those apes should
coincide so fully with those known of the present
day, but to my mind it is quite certain that the ape
of which he gives an account was neither a gorilla
nor chimpanzee, nor is there anything to show that
either of these ever occupied that part of the world,
or that any similar type has done so. It is clear from
the evidence that the ape described by him was not
an anthropoid, but was the large, dog-faced monkey
technically called <i class="classification">cynocephalus</i>. These animals are
found all along the north coast of the Gulf of Guinea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
but there is not a trace of any true ape along it north
of Cameroon River, which empties into the sea
about 4° north of the equator. Here begins the
first trace of the chimpanzee. In passing along the
windward coast, casual reports are current to the
effect that gorillas and chimpanzees occupy the
interior north of there; but when these reports are
sifted down to solid facts, it always turns out to be
a big baboon or monkey upon which the story rests.
Its likeness to man as described by Hanno was
doubtless the work of fancy, and the name <i class="classification">troglodytes</i>
which he gave to it shows that he knew but little of
its habits, or cared but little for the exactness of his
statements.</p>

<p>The account given by Henry Battel, in 1590,
contains a thread of truth woven into a web of fantasy.
He must have heard the stories he relates, or
seen the specimens along the coast north of the
Congo, and there are certain facts which point to
this conclusion. The name <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">pongo</i> which he gave to
one of them belongs to the Fiot tongue, which is
spoken by the native tribes around Loango. Those
people apply the name to the gorilla, and is commonly
understood to be synonymous with the name
<i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i>, used by the tribes north of there, and always
applied to the gorilla. To me, however, it appears
to coincide with the name <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">ntyii</i> as used by the
Esyira people for another ape which is described in
the chapter devoted to gorillas. It was from Loango
that Dr. Falkenstein secured an ape under that
name in 1876. It is singular that Baron Wurmb, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
1780, makes use of this same name <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">pongo</i> for an
orang. I have not been able to learn where he
acquired this name, but it appears to be a native
Fiot name, and the history of their language is
fairly well known for more than 400 years. The
other name "Enjocko," given by Battel to the other
ape, is beyond a doubt a corruption of the native
name <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">ntyigo</i> (ntcheego), and this name belongs north
of the Congo from Mayumba to Gaboon. He may
have inferred that these apes occupied Angola, but
there is not a vestige of proof that any ape exists in
that part of Africa. Even the native tribes of that
part have no indigenous name for either one of these
apes. Other parts of his account are erroneous, and
while he may have believed that those apes "go in
bodies to kill many natives that travel in the wood,"
and the natives may have told him such a thing, the
apes do not practise such a habit. With all their
sagacity they have no idea of the unity of action.
If a band of them were attacked, they would no
doubt act together in their defence, but it is not to
be believed that they ever preconcert any plan of
attack. Neither do these apes ever assault elephants.
He is one animal they hold in mortal
dread. I have incidentally mentioned elsewhere
the conduct of my two kulus on board the ship
when they saw a young elephant. Chico, the big
ape that has also been mentioned, was often vicious
and stubborn. Whenever he refused to obey his
keeper or became violent, an elephant was brought
in sight of his cage. On seeing it he became as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
docile as a lamb, and showed every sign of the most
intense fear. Mr. Bailey himself told me of the
dread both of his apes had for an elephant. Battel
was also wrong in the mode he described of the
mother carrying its young, and the apes using sticks
or clubs.</p>

<p>The ape known as "Mafuka," which was exhibited
in Dresden in 1875, was also brought from the
Loango coast, and it is possible that this is the ape
to which the native name <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">pongo</i> really belonged.
This specimen in many respects conforms to the
description of the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">ntyii</i> given, but the idea suggested
by certain writers that "Mafuka" was a cross
between the gorilla and chimpanzee is not, to my
mind, a tenable supposition. It would be difficult
to believe that two apes of different species in a wild
state would cross, but to believe that two that belonged
to different genera would do so is even more
illogical.</p>

<p>I may state here, however, again that some of
the Esyira people advance such a theory concerning
the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">ntyii</i>, but the belief is not general, and those
best skilled in woodcraft regard them as distinct
species.</p>

<p>To quote, in pidjin English, the exact version of
their relationship as it was given to me by my interpreter
while in that country, may be of interest to the
reader. I may remark, by way of explaining the
nature of pidjin English, that it is a literal translation
of the native mode of thought into English
words. The statement was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
"<i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">Ntyii</i> be one: <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> be one: all two be one, one.
<i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">Nytii</i> 'e one mudder: <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">jnina</i> 'e one mudder: all two
'e one, one. <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">Nytii</i> 'e one fader: <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> all same 'e
one fader, 'e one. 'E all two one fader." By which
the native means to say that the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">nytii</i> has one mother
and the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> has one mother, so that the two have
two mothers, but both have one father, therefore
they are half-brothers.</p>

<p>The other version given in denial of this statement
was as follows:</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">Nytii</i> 'e one mudder: <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> 'e one mudder. 'E
one, one. <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">Nytii</i> 'e one fader: <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> 'e one fader.
'E be one, one. All two 'e one, one. <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">Nytii</i> 'im
mudder, <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> 'im mudder. 'E brudder. <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">Nytii</i> 'im
fader, <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> 'im fader 'e brudder. All two 'e one, one."</p>

<p>The translation of this elegant speech is, that the
<i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">nytii</i> has a mother, and the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> has a mother which
are not the same but sisters. The <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">nytii</i> has a father,
and the <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">njina</i> has a father which are not the same,
but are brothers, and therefore the two apes are only
cousins, which in the native esteem is a remote
degree of kinship.</p>

<p>The ape described by Lopez certainly belonged
to the territory north of the Congo, which coast he
explored, and gave his name to a cape about forty
miles south of the equator, and it still bears the
name Cape Lopez. At that time, however, it is
probable that most of the low country now occupied
by these apes was covered with water; that the
lakes of that region were then all embraced in one
great estuary, reaching from Fernan Vaz to Nazareth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Bay, and extending eastward to the Foot hills
below Lamberene. There is abundant evidence to
show that such a state has once existed there, but it
is not probable that these apes have ever changed
their latitude.</p>

<p>The name "soko" appears to be a local name for
the ordinary type of chimpanzee found throughout
the whole range of their domain, and known in other
parts by other names.</p>

<p>In Malimbu the name "kulu" appears to apply to
the same species, while in the south-western part of
their habitat that name, coupled with the verb
"kamba," is confined strictly to the other type.
Along the northern borders of the district to which
that species belongs, but where he is very seldom
found and little known to the natives, he is called
Mkami tribe, "kanga ntyigo," to distinguish him
from the common variety to which the latter name
only is applied.</p>

<p>The etymology of the name <i xml:lang="mye" lang="mye">kanga</i> as applied to
this ape is rather obscure. In common use it is a
verb with the normal meaning to "parch" or "fry,"
and hence the secondary meaning to "prepare."
Since this ape is said to be of a higher order of the
race, the term is used to signify that he is "better
prepared" than the other. That is to say, he is
prepared to think and talk in a better manner.</p>

<p>Another history of this word appears to be more
probable. The ape to which the name is applied
lives between the Mkami country and the Congo, and
the name is possibly a perversion of kongo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
implies the kind of <i xml:lang="vif" lang="vif">ntyigo</i> that lives towards the
great river of that name. The etymology of African
names is always difficult because there is no record
of them, but many of them can be traced out with
great precision, and some of them are unique.</p>

<p>The name M'Bouvé, as given by Du Chaillu, I
have not been able to identify. In one part of the
country I was told that the word meant the "chief"
or head of a family. In another part it was said to
mean something like an advocate or champion, and
was only applied to one ape in a family group. The
Rev. A.&nbsp;C. Goode, a zealous missionary who recently
died near Batanga, was stationed for twelve years at
Gaboon. During that time he travelled all through
the Ogowe and Gaboon valleys. He was familiar
with the languages of that part, and he explained
the word in about the same way.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said concerning the veracity of
Paul Du Chaillu, there is one thing that must be
said to his credit. He gave to the world more
knowledge of these apes than all other men put
together had ever done before, and while he may
have given a touch of colour to many incidents, and
related some native yarns, he told a vast amount of
valuable truth, and I can forgive him for anything
which he may have misstated, except one. That is
starting that story about gorillas chewing up gun-barrels.
It has been a staple yarn in stock ever
since, and the instant you ask a native any question
about the habits of a gorilla he begins with this.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that I have made careful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
methodic efforts to determine the exact boundary of
the habitat and the real habits of these two apes, I
feel at liberty to speak with an air of authority. I
have acquired my knowledge on the subject by going
to their own country and living in their own jungle,
and I have thus obtained their secrets from first
hands. With due respect to those who write books
and speak freely upon subjects of which they know
but little, I beg leave to suggest that if the authors
had gone into the jungle and lived among those
animals instead of consulting others who know less
than themselves about it, many of them would have
written in a very different strain. I do not mean
this as a rebuke to any one, but seeing the same old
stories repeated year after year, and knowing that
there is no truth in them, I feel it incumbent as a
duty to challenge them.</p>

<p>I believe that in the future it will be shown that
there are two types of gorilla as distinct from each
other as the two chimpanzees now known. This
second variety of gorilla will be found between the
third and fifth parallels south and east of the delta
district, but west of the Congo. I believe it was
represented in the ape "Mafuka." My researches
among the apes have been confined chiefly to the
two kinds heretofore described, but I have seen and
studied in a superficial way the orang and the gibbon.
I am not prepared as yet to discuss the habits of
those two apes, but as they form a part of the group
of anthropoids we cannot dismiss them without
honourable mention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
The orang-outan, as he is called in his own
country, is known to zoology by the first of these
terms alone. He is a native of Borneo and Sumatra,
and opinions differ as to whether there are two
species or only one.</p>

<p>The general plan of the skeleton of the orang is
very much the same as in the other apes. The chief
points of difference are that it has one bone more in
the wrist and one joint less in the spinal column than
is found in man. He has thirteen pairs of ribs,
which appear to be more constant in their number
than in man. His arms are longer and his legs
shorter in proportion to his body than the other two
apes. The type of the skull is peculiar, and combines
to a certain extent more human-like form in one
part with a more beast-like form in another. The
usual height of an adult male is about fifty-one
inches.</p>

<p>I have never had an opportunity of studying this
ape in a wild state, and have only had access to four
of them in captivity, all of which were young and
most of them inferior specimens. He is the most
obtuse or stupid of the four great apes. And were
it not for his skeleton alone he would be assigned
a place below the gibbon, for in point of speech
and mental calibre he is far inferior. The best
authorities perhaps upon the habits of this ape in a
wild state are Messrs. W.&nbsp;T. Horniday and R.&nbsp;A.
Wallace.</p>

<p>The first and last in order of the anthropoid apes
is the gibbon; he is much smaller in size, greater in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
variety, and more active than any other of the group.
His habitat is in the south-east of Asia; its outline
is vaguely defined, but it includes the Malayan
Peninsula and many of the contiguous islands east
and south of it.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the gibbon is the most delicate
and graceful in build of all the apes, and in this respect
is as far superior to man as man is to the gorilla,
except for the long arms and digits. He is the only
one of the four that can walk in an erect position,
but in doing this the gibbon is awkward, and often
uses his arms to balance himself, sometimes by
touching his hands to the ground, or at other times
raising them above his head or extending them on
either side. The length of them is such that he can
touch the fingers to the ground while the body is
nearly if not quite erect. In the spinal column he
has two and sometimes three sections more than
man. His digits are very much longer, but his legs
are nearly the same length in proportion to his body
as those of man. He has fourteen pairs of ribs.</p>

<p>The gibbon is the most active, if not the most
intelligent, of all apes. He is more arboreal in habit
than any other. Many wonderful stories are told of
his agility in climbing and leaping from limb to limb.
One authentic report credits one of these apes with
leaping a distance of forty-two feet from the limb of
one tree to that of another. Perhaps a better term
is to call it swinging rather than leaping, as these
flights are performed by the arms. Another account
is, that one swinging by one hand propelled himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
a horizontal distance of eighteen feet through the
air, seizing a bird in flight, and alighting safely upon
another limb with his prey in hand.</p>

<p>There are several of this ape known, the largest
of which is about three feet high, but the usual
height is not more than thirty inches. The voice of
one species is remarkable for its strength, scope and
quality above all other apes. Most of the members
of this genus are endowed with better vocal qualities
than other animals. This ends the list of the man-like
apes, and next in order after them come the
monkeys, but we will deal with that subject more at
length at some future time.</p>

<p>The descent, as we have elsewhere observed, from
the highest ape to the lowest monkey presents one
unbroken scale of imbricating planes; and we have
seen in what degree man is related to the higher ape.
From whence we may discern in what degree his
physical nature is the same as that of all the order to
which he belongs. No matter in what respect he
may differ in his mental and moral nature, his likeness
to them should at least restrain his pride, evoke
his sympathy, and share the bounty of his benevolence.
Let man realise to its full extent that he is
one in nature with the rest, and they will receive the
benign influence of his dignity without impairing it,
while he will elevate himself by having given it.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TREATMENT OF APES IN CAPTIVITY</span></h2>

<p>In conclusion, I deem it in order to offer a few
remarks with regard to the causes of death among
these apes, and to the proper treatment of the
animals in captivity. We know so little and assume
so much concerning them that we often violate the
very laws under which they live.</p>

<p>We have already noticed the fact that the gorilla
is confined by nature to a low, humid region, reeking
with miasma and the effluvia of decaying vegetation.
The atmosphere in which he thrives is one in which
human life can hardly exist. We know in part why
man cannot live in such an atmosphere and under
such conditions, but we cannot say with certainty
why the ape does do so. It would seem that the
very element that is fatal to the life of man gives
strength and vitality to the gorilla.</p>

<p>We know that all forms of animal life are not
affected in the same way by the same things,
and while it may be said in round numbers that
whatever is good for man is good for apes also, it is
not a fact.</p>

<p>The human race is the most widely distributed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
any genus of mammals and, as a race, can undergo
the greatest extremes of change in climate, food and
other conditions of any other animal. His migratory
habits, both inherent and acquired, have fitted him
for a life of vicissitudes, and such a life inures him
as an individual to all extremes. On the other hand,
the gorilla, as a genus, is confined to a small habitat,
which is uniform in climate, products and topography;
and having been so long restricted to these conditions
he is unfitted for like changes, and when such
are forced upon him the result must always be to
his injury.</p>

<p>In certain parts of the American tropics there is
found a rich, grey moss growing in great profusion
in certain localities and on certain kinds of trees. It
is not confined to any certain level, but thrives best
on the lowest elevations. Under favourable conditions
it will grow at altitudes far above the surrounding
swamps. The character and quantity, however,
are measured by the altitude at which it grows. It
is an aerial plant, and may be detached from the
boughs of one tree and transplanted upon those of
another. It may be taken with safety for a great
distance so long as an atmosphere is supplied to it
that is suited to its nature; but when removed from
its normal conditions and placed in a purer air it
begins to languish and soon dies. If it be returned
in time, however, to its former place or one of like
character it will revive and continue to grow.</p>

<p>What element this plant extracts from the impure
air is a matter of doubt; but it cannot be carbonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
acid gas which is the chief food of plants, nor it
cannot be any form of nitrogen; and it is well known
that the plant cannot long survive in a pure atmosphere.
Whatever the ingredient extracted may be,
it is certain that it is one that is deadly to human
life, and one which other plants refuse. Moisture
and heat alone cannot account for it.</p>

<p>We have another striking instance in the eucalyptus,
which lives upon the poison of the air around
it. There are many other cases in vegetable life,
and while the animal is a higher organism than the
plant, there are certain laws of life that obtain in
both kingdoms which are the same in principle.</p>

<p>Between the case of the gorilla and that of the
plant there is some analogy. It may not be the
same element that sustains them both, but it is
possible that the very microbes which germinate
disease and prove fatal to man sustain the life of the
ape in the prime of health. The poison which
destroys life in man preserves it in the ape.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee is distributed over a much greater
range, and is capable of undergoing a much greater
degree of change in food and temperature. The
history of these apes in captivity shows that the
chimpanzee lives much longer in that state and
requires much less care. From my own observation
I assert that all of these apes can undergo a greater
range of temperature than they can of humidity.
This appears to be one of the essential things to the
life of a gorilla, and one fatal mistake made in
treating him is furnishing him with a dry, warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
atmosphere, and depriving him of the poison contained
in the malarious air in which he spends his
entire life. Both of these apes need humidity. The
chimpanzee will live longer than a gorilla in a dry
air, but neither of them can long survive it, and it
would appear that a salt atmosphere is best for the
gorilla.</p>

<p>I believe that one of these apes could be kept in
good condition for any length of time if he were
supplied with a normal humidity in an atmosphere
laden with miasma and allowed to vary in temperature.
A constant degree of heat is not good for
any animal, there is nowhere in all the earth that
nature sustains a uniform degree of it. We need not
go to either extreme, but a change is requisite to
bring into play all the organs of the body.</p>

<p>The theory of their treatment which I would
advance is to build them a house entirely apart from
that of any other animal. It should be 18 or 20
feet wide by 35 or 40 long, and at least 15 feet high.
It should have no floor except earth, and that should
be of sandy loam or vegetable mould. In one end
of this building there should be a pool of water
12 or 15 feet in diameter, and embedded in the
mould under the water should be a steam coil to
regulate the temperature as might be desired. In
this pool should be grown a dense crop of water
plants such as are found in the marshes of the country
in which the gorilla lives. This pool should not be
cleaned out or the water changed, but the plants
should be allowed to grow and decay in a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
way. Neither the pool nor the house should be kept
at a uniform heat, but allowed to vary from 60 to
90 degrees.</p>

<p>In addition to the things mentioned, the place
should be provided with the means of giving it a
spray of tepid water, which should be turned on
once or twice a day, and allowed to continue for at
least an hour at a time. The water for this purpose
should be taken from the pool, but should never be
warmer than the usual temperature of tropical rain.
The animal should not be required to take a bath
in this way, but should be left to his own choice
about it.</p>

<p>The house should be separated by a thin partition
that could be removed at will, and the other end of
the building from the pool should be occupied by
a strong tree, either dead or alive, to afford the
inmates proper exercise. The rule that visitors or
strangers should not annoy or tease them should
be enforced without respect to person, time, or rank.
No visitor should be allowed on any terms to give
them any kind of food. The reasons for these
precautions are obvious to any one familiar with
the keeping of animals, but in the case of a gorilla
their observance cannot be waived with impunity.</p>

<p>The south side of the house should be of glass,
and at least half of the top should be of the same.
These parts should be provided with heavy canvas
curtains, to be drawn over them so as to adjust or
regulate the sunlight. In summer-time the building
should be kept quite open so as to admit air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
rain. The ape does not need to be pampered: on
the contrary, he should be permitted to rough it.
Half of the gorillas that have ever been in captivity
have died from over-nursing. By nature they are
strong and robust if the proper conditions are supplied,
but when these are changed he becomes a
frail and tender creature. They should not be
restricted to a vegetable diet nor limited to a few
articles of food of any kind, but should be allowed
to select such things as they prefer to eat. I have
grave doubts as to the wisdom of limiting the
quantity. One mistake is often committed in the
treatment of animals, and that is to continue the
same diet at all times and limit that to one or two
items. It may be observed that the higher the form
of organism is the more diverse the taste becomes,
and while very hardy animals or those of low forms
may be restricted to one staple kind of food, the
higher forms demand a change.</p>

<p>One thing above all others that I would inhibit is
the use of straw of any kind in their cage for beds
or any other purpose. If it be desired to furnish
them with such a comfort, nothing should ever be
used but dead leaves if they can be supplied. In
their absence a canvas hammock or wire matting
should be used. There are certain kinds of dust
given off by the dry straw of all cereal plants. This
is deleterious to the health of man, but vastly more
so to these apes. It is taken into the lungs, and
through them act upon other parts of the body by
suppressing the circulation and respiration. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
matter how clean the straw may be, the effect will
be the same in the end. Hay is better than straw,
but even this should not be used.</p>

<p>Another thing which is necessary is to entertain
or amuse them in some way, otherwise they become
despondent and gloomy. It is believed by those
who are familiar with these apes that loneliness or
solitude is a fruitful cause of death. This is especially
so with the gorilla. I have a photograph of one
that was kept by a trader on the coast of Africa for
nearly three years. She was devoted to him, and
was never content when not in his company. His
business required him to make a journey of a few
days to the interior. He left the gorilla at his place
on the coast where she had lived up to this time.
The day after he departed she became morose and
fretful, and within a few days died without any
apparent cause except pining. This was observed
by natives and by white traders, and her death has
always been ascribed to the cause assigned. She
was well known to all the traders on that part of the
coast, and has been regarded as one of the best
specimens known. She is the only one that I have
ever known to become devoted to a human being.</p>

<p>Another important fact that is little known but
very singular is, that tobacco smoke is absolutely
fatal to a gorilla. Every native hunter that I met
in Africa testifies that this simple thing will kill any
gorilla in the forest if he is subjected to the fumes
for a short time. I have reason to believe that it is
true. It may not prove fatal in every instance, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
it will in many. The chimpanzee is not so much
affected by it, although he dislikes it, but the gorilla
detests it and shows at all times his strong aversion
to it. I have no doubt that this is one of the reasons
that these apes always die on board the ships by
which they are brought from Africa.</p>

<p>Both of these apes are possessed, in a degree, of
savage and resentful instincts. But these are much
stronger in the gorilla than in the chimpanzee. He
therefore requires firm and consistent treatment.
This can be used without being severe or cruel, but
the intellect of the gorilla must not be underrated.
He studies the motives and intentions of man with a
keen perception, and is seldom mistaken in his interpretation
of them. He often manifests a violent dislike
for certain persons, and when such is discovered
to be the case the object of his dislike should not be
permitted in his presence, for the result is to enrage
the ape and excite his nervous nature. When they
become sullen or obstinate they should not be coaxed
or indulged, nor yet used with harshness. They
should either be left alone for the time or diverted
by a change of treatment.</p>

<p>At this point I submit the foregoing to the world
as the sum of my labours in this special field of
research up to this time. I regret that I have been
compelled to deny much that has been said, but I
make no apology for having done so. In this work
I have sought to place these apes before the reader
as I have seen them in their native forest. I have
not clothed them in fine raiment or invested them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
glamour, but I trust that this contribution may be
found worthy of the respect of all men who love
Nature and respect fidelity.</p>

<p>I have the vanity to believe that the methods of
study which I have employed will be made the
means of farther research by more able students than
the writer.</p>
